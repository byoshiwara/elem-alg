    <title>Chapter 2 Summary and Review</title>

<subsection><title>Lesson 2.1 Signed Numbers</title><p><ul>
<li>The natural numbers, zero, and the negatives of the natural numbers are called the <term>integers</term>.</li>
<li><p>We use special symbols to indicate order: 
	<me>\begin{aligned}
                \blert{\lt} \amp ~~~~ \text{means}~~~~  \blert{\text{is less than}}\\
                \blert{\gt} \amp ~~~~ \text{means}~~~~  \blert{\text{is greater than}}               
                \end{aligned}</me></p></li>
<li>The <term>absolute value</term> of a number is the unsigned part of the number. It is never negative.</li>

<li><assemblage><title>Rules for Adding Integers</title><p><ol label="1">
	<li>To add two numbers with the same sign, add their absolute values. The sum has the same sign as the numbers.</li>
	<li>To add two numbers with opposite signs, subtract their absolute values. The sum has the same sign as the number with the larger absolute value.</li></ol></p></assemblage></li>

<li><assemblage><title>Rules for Subtracting Integers</title>
<p>To subtract <m>b</m> from <m>a</m>:<ol label="1">
	<li>Change the sign of <m>b</m>.</li>
	<li>Change the subtraction to addition.</li>
	<li>Proceed as in addition.</li></ol></p></assemblage></li>

<li><assemblage><title>Products and Quotients of Signed Numbers</title><p><ol label="1">
	<li>The product or quotient of two numbers with opposite signs is a negative number.</li>
	<li>The product or quotient of two numbers with the same sign is a positive number.</li></ol></p></assemblage></li>

<li><assemblage><title>Quotients Involving Zero</title>
<p>If <m>a</m> is any nonzero number, then
<me>\blert{\dfrac{0}{a} = 0}~~~~~~\text{and}~~~~~~ \blert{\dfrac{a}{0} ~~ \text{is undefined.}}</me></p></assemblage></li></ul></p>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Section 2.2 Expressions and Equations</title><p><ul>
<li>When we evaluate an algebraic expression, we follow the order of operations.</li> 
<li>When we evaluate an algebraic expression at a negative number, we enclose the negative numbers in parentheses.</li></ul></p></subsection>

<subsection><title>Section 2.3 Graphs of Linear Equations</title><p><ul>
<li>An equation of the form <m>y=ax+b</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are constants, is called a <term>linear equation</term> because its graph is a straight line.</li>
<li>We can graph a linear equation by evaluating the expression <m>ax+b</m> at several values of <m>x</m> and then plotting points.</li>
<li>We use a <term>Cartesian coordinate system</term> to make a graph that includes negative values of the variables.</li>
<li>The graph of an equation is a picture of the solutions of the equation. Each point on the graph represents a solution.</li></ul></p></subsection>

<subsection><title>Section 2.4 Linear Equations and Inequalities</title><p><ul>
<li>To solve an equation that involves two or more operations, we undo those operations in reverse order.</li>
<li>A statement that uses one of the symbols or is called an <term>inequality</term>.</li>

<li><assemblage><title>Rules for Solving Inequalities</title><p><ol label = "1">
	<li>We can add or subtract the same quantity on both sides.</li> 
	<li>We can multiply or divide both sides by the same positive number.</li>  
	<li>If we multiply or divide both sides by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality.</li></ol></p></assemblage></li>

<li>Each point on the graph of an equation represents a solution of the equation. To solve the equation for a particular <m>y</m>-value, we locate the corresponding point on the graph.</li>
<li>To solve a <term>compound inequality</term>, we perform the steps needed to isolate <m>x</m> on all three sides of the inequality.</li></ul></p></subsection>

<subsection><title>Section 2.5 Like Terms</title><p><ul>
<li>Two algebraic expressions are <term>equivalent</term> if they name the same number for all values of the variable.</li> 
<li><term>Like terms</term> are any terms that are exactly alike in their variable factors. By adding or subtracting like terms we can replace one algebraic expression by a shorter or simpler one.</li> 
<li>The numerical factor in a term is called the <term>numerical coefficient</term>, or just the <term>coefficient</term> of the term.</li>
<li>Replacing an expression by a simpler equivalent one is called <term>simplifying</term> the expression.</li>

<li><assemblage><title>To add or subtract like terms</title>
<p>Add or subtract the numerical coefficients of the terms. Do not change the variable factors of the terms.</p></assemblage></li>

<li><assemblage><title>Removing parentheses</title><p><ol label="1">
<li>Parentheses following a plus sign may be omitted; each term within parentheses keeps its original sign.</li>
<li>To remove parentheses that follow a minus sign, we change the sign of each term within parentheses and then omit the parentheses and the minus sign.</li></ol></p></assemblage></li>

<li><assemblage><title>Steps for Solving Linear Equations</title><p><ol label="1">
	<li>Combine like terms on each side of the equation.</li>
	<li>By adding or subtracting the same quantity on both sides of the equation, get all the variable terms on one side and all the constant terms on the other.</li>
	<li>Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable to obtain an equation of the form <m>x=a</m>.</li></ol></p></assemblage></li>
</ul></p></subsection>

<subsection><title>Review Questions</title>
<p>Use complete sentences to answer the questions.<ol label = "1">
<li>Explain the terms natural numbers, whole numbers, and integers.</li>
<li>A classmate claims that the opposite of a number and the absolute value of a number are the same, and uses <m>x=-3</m>   as an example. Do you agree? Give examples of your own.</li>
<li><p>You have probably heard people say that "two negatives make a positive."  For which of the four arithmetic operations is this statement<ol label="a">
	<li>always true?</li>
	<li>always false?</li>
	<li>sometimes true and sometimes false?</li></ol>
	Make up an example for each case.</p></li>
<li>In a Cartesian coordinate system, the axes divide the plane into four <fillin characters="5"/>. The point <m>(0,0)</m> is called the <fillin characters="6"/>.</li>
<li>Explain how to add or subtract like terms.</li>
<li>What is wrong with this statement?  <m>8x-(2x-3)=6x-3)</m></li>  
<li>When solving an inequality, we must remember to <fillin characters="6"/> if we <fillin characters="6"/> both sides by <fillin characters="6"/>.</li>
<li>Explain how to use a graph to solve an equation.</li>
<li>Give an example of a quotient that is undefined.</li>
<li>Explain why <m>-\dfrac{a}{b}</m> is not equal to <m>\dfrac{-a}{-b}</m>.</li></ol></p></subsection>
