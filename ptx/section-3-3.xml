<subsection><title>Rate of Change</title>

<assemblage><p>A <term>rate of change</term> is a type of ratio that measures how one variable changes with respect to another.</p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>In order to fire a particular kind of pottery, the pieces must first be cured by raising the temperature slowly and evenly.  Sonia checks the temperature in the drying oven at ten-minute intervals, and records the following data.
	<sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">              
                    <row bottom="minor">

The heat in the oven should not increase any faster than 0.5 degree per minute. Is the temperature in the oven within the safe limits?</p></statement>
<solution><p>A graph of the data is shown below. 
	<sidebyside width="35%"><image source="images/fig-3-3-ex1.png"><description>graph</description></image></sidebyside>
Sonia calculates the rate at which the temperature is rising by finding the following ratio:
	<me>\dfrac{\text{change in temperature}}{\text{change in time}}</me>
For example, over the first 10 minutes, the temperature rises from 70 degrees to 74 degrees, so
	<me>\dfrac{\text{change in temperature}}{\text{change in time}} = \dfrac{\text{4 degrees}}{\text{10 minutes}}</me>
or 0.4 degree per minute. This is less than the maximum rate recommended for curing the pottery.</p></solution></example>

<p>You can check that over each ten-minute interval the temperature again rises by four degrees, so it appears that the oven is heating up at an acceptable rate.</p>

<subsection><title>Slope</title>
<p>We introduce some new notation to use when calculating a rate of change. </p>

<assemblage><p>The Greek letter <m>\blert{\Delta}</m> ("delta") is used in mathematics to indicate change.</p></assemblage>

<p>In Example 1,  we used the variable <m>x</m> to represent time and <m>y</m> to represent the temperature, so we denote the ratio <m>\dfrac{\text{change in temperature}}{\text{change in time}}</m> by <m>\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m>.  With this notation, we calculate the rate of change of temperature between the data points <m>(20, 78)</m> and <m>(50, 90)</m> as follows:
	<me>\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\dfrac{\text{12 degrees}}{\text{30 minutes}} = 0.4 \text{degree per minute}</me></p>

<p>We can illustrate the rate of change on a graph of the data, as shown below.  We move from the point <m>(20, 78)</m> to the point <m>(50, 90)</m> by moving horizontally a distance of <m>\Delta x = 30</m> and then vertically a distance of <m>\Delta y = 12</m>. 
	<sidebyside width="45%"><image source="images/fig-3-3-1.png"><description>graph</description></image></sidebyside> 
The rate of change of one variable with respect to another is so important in applications that the ratio <m>\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m> is given a name; it is called <term>slope</term>, and is usually denoted by the letter <m>m</m>.</p>

<assemblage><title>Slope</title>
<p>The <term>slope</term> of a line is defined by the ratio
	<me>\blert{\dfrac{\text{change in } y\text{-coordinate}}{\text{change in } x\text{-coordinate}}}</me>
as we move from one point to another on the line.  In symbols,
	<me>\blert{m=\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}}</me></p></assemblage>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>The slope of a line measures how fast the <m>y</m>-coordinate changes as we increase the <m>x</m>-coordinate of points on the line.  More specifically, when we move one unit in the <m>x</m>-direction, how many units should we move in the <m>y</m>-direction to get back to the line?</p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Use the points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> to compute the slope of the line shown.</p>
	<sidebyside width="40%"><image source="images/fig-3-3-ex2.png"><description>graph</description></image></sidebyside>
	</statement>

<solution><p>The point <m>A</m> has coordinates <m>(1,3)</m>, and <m>B</m> has coordinates <m>(5,6)</m>.  As we move along the line from <m>A(1,3)</m> to <m>B(5,6)</m>, the <m>x</m>-coordinate changes by 3 units, and the <m>y</m>-coordinate changes by 4 units. The slope of the line is thus
	<me>\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\dfrac{3}{4}</me>
The slope tells us that if we start at any point on the line and move 1 unit in the <m>x</m>-direction, we must move <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> unit in the <m>y</m>-direction to return to the line.</p></solution></example>

<warning><p>Note the difference between the statements <m>y=3</m> and <m>\Delta y = 3</m>; they are not the same.  When we discuss a graph,<ul> 
	<li><m>y=3~~</m> means that the <m>y</m>-coordinate of a particular point is 3, but</li>
	<li><m> \Delta y = 3~~</m> means that the <m>y</m>-coordinate changes by 3 units when we move from one point to another.</li></ul></p></warning>

<subsection><title>Meaning of Slope</title>
<p>In Example 1, we graphed the temperature of a pottery oven over time. We calculated the slope of the graph as
	<me>\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = 0.4~~ \text{degrees per minute}</me>
The slope gives us the rate of change of the temperature with respect to time:  the temperature is increasing at a rate of 0.4 degrees per minute.</p>

<assemblage><p>The slope of a line measures the rate of change of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.</p></assemblage>

<p>In different situations, this rate might be interpreted as a rate of growth or a speed.  The slope of a graph can give us valuable information about the variables involved. </p> 

<example><statement><p>The graph shows the distance traveled by a driver for a cross-country trucking firm in terms of the number of hours she has been on the road.
	<sidebyside width="30%"><image source="images/fig-3-3-ex3.png"><description>graph</description></image></sidebyside>
<ol label="a">
	<li>Compute the slope of the graph.</li>
	<li>What is the meaning of the slope for this problem?</li></ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
	<li><p>Choose any two points on the line, say <m>G(2,100)</m> and <m>H(4,200)</m> shown in the figure. As we move from <m>G</m> to <m>H</m> we find 
		<me>m = \dfrac{\Delta D}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{100}{2} = 50</me>
	The slope of the line is 50.</p></li>
	<li><p>The best way to understand the slope is to include units in the calculation.
  		<me>\dfrac{\Delta D}{\Delta t}~~ \text{means}~~\dfrac{\text{change in distance}}{\text{change in time}}</me>
  	or 
  		<me>\dfrac{\Delta D}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{100 \text{ miles}}{2~ \text{hours}} =50~ \text{miles per hour}</me>
The slope represents the trucker's average speed or velocity.</p></li></ol></p></solution></example>

<warning><p>In Example 3, we refer to a point by a capital letter and the coordinates of the point, like this: <m>H(4,200)</m>. This means that <m>t=4</m> and <m>D=200</m> at the point <m>H</m>. Do not confuse the coordinates of a particular point with the values of <m>\Delta t</m> and <m>\Delta D</m> obtained by moving from one point to a second point.</p></warning>

<subsection><title>Geometrical Meaning of Slope</title>
<p>Suppose we graph two lines with positive slope on the same coordinate system. If we move along the lines from left to right, then the line with the larger slope will be steeper. This makes sense if we think of the slope as a rate of change: The line whose <m>y</m>-coordinate is increasing faster with respect to <m>x</m> is the steeper line.</p>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>You can verify the slope given for each line in figure (a) by computing <m>\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m>. For each unit you increase in the <m>x</m>-direction, the steepest line increases 2 units in the <m>y</m>-direction, the middle line increases 1 unit in the <m>x</m>-direction, and the flattest line increases only <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> unit.</p>
	<sidebyside width="80%"><image source="images/fig-3-3-2.png"><description>graph</description></image></sidebyside>
<p>Figure (b) shows several lines with negative slopes. These lines slant downwards or decrease as we move from left to right. The more negative the slope, the more sharply the line decreases. For both increasing and decreasing graphs, the larger the absolute value of the slope, the steeper the graph.</p></assemblage>

<warning><p>Slopes measure the relative steepness of two lines only if they are graphed on axes with the same scales.  Changing the scale on either the <m>x</m>-axis or the <m>y</m>-axis can greatly alter the appearance of a graph.</p></warning>
