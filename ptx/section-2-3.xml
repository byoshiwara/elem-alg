    <title>Graphs of Linear Equations</title>

<subsection><title>Graphing Equations</title>

<assemblage><p>An equation of the form <m>y=ax+b</m>,  where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are constants, is called a <term>linear equation</term> because its graph is a straight line.</p></assemblage>

<p>We can graph a linear equation by evaluating the expression <m>ax+b</m> at several values of <m>x</m> and then plotting points.</p>

<example><statement><p>At 6 am the temperature was <m>50 \degree</m>, and it has been rising by <m>4 \degree</m> every hour.<ol label="a">  
	<li>Write an equation for the temperature, <m>T</m>, after <m>h</m> hours.</li>
	<li>Graph your equation.</li></ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
	<li>We set <m>h=0</m> at 6 am.  At that time, <m>T=50</m>.  Because the temperature is rising by <m>4 \degree</m> every hour, we multiply the number of hours by 4 and add the result to 50 to get the new temperature. Thus, our equation is <m>T=50+4h</m>.</li>
	<li><p>Step 1: We make a table of values for the equation. We choose some values for <m>h</m>, as shown in the first column of the table below. For each value of <m>h</m>, we evaluate the formula for <m>T</m>, and we record these values in the second column of the table.

	<p>Step 2: We use the values in the table to help us choose scales for the axes. For this graph, the  input values are less than 10, but the largest output value is 70. We use increments of 1 on the horizontal or <m>h</m>-axis and increments of 10 on the vertical or <m>T</m>-axis.</p>
	<p>Step 3: Each ordered pair gives us a point on the graph. We plot the points on the grid and connect them with a smooth curve. All the points should lie on a straight line.

<subsection><title>Cartesian Coordinate System</title>
<p>Many graphs include negative values as well as positive values. To make such a graph, we construct a <term>Cartesian coordinate system</term>, named after the French mathematician and philosopher Ren√© Descartes.</p>   

<p>We draw two perpendicular number lines for the horizontal and vertical axes. The two axes divide the plane into four <term>quadrants</term>, or regions, as shown below. We often use <m>x</m> for the input variable and  <m>y</m> for the output variable, so the horizontal axis is called the <m>x</m>-axis and the vertical axis is the <m>y</m>-axis. The axes intersect at the zero point of each number line. The coordinates of this intersection point, called the <term>origin</term>, are <m>(0,0)</m>.</p>
 <sidebyside width="35%"><image source="images/fig-2-3-1.png"><description>grid</description></image></sidebyside>

 <reading-questions>
    <exercise number="3"><statement><p>What are the coordinates of the origin?</p></statement>
    	<answer><m>(0,0)</m></answer></exercise>
    <exercise number="4"><statement><p>True or False: The <m>x</m>-coordinate of any point on the <m>y</m>-axis is zero.
</p></statement>
    	<answer><p>True</p></answer></exercise>
</reading-questions>

<example><statement><p>The figure below shows how to plot points on a Cartesian grid. Points in the upper right quadrant have both coordinates positive. Points with negative <m>x</m>-coordinates are plotted to the left of the <m>x</m>-axis, and points with negative <m>y</m>-coordinates are plotted below the <m>y</m>-axis.</p>
<p> For example, the point <m>(-2,1)</m> is plotted 2 units to the left of the <m>x</m>-axis and 1 unit above the <m>y</m>-axis. In which quadrant are both coordinates negative?</p>
<sidebyside width="35%"><image source="images/fig-2-3-ex2.png"><description>points</description></image></sidebyside>
</statement></example>

<reading-questions>
    <exercise number="5"><statement><p>True or False: The notation <m>(5,3)</m> represents two points, one on the <m>x</m>-axis and one on the <m>y</m>-axis.</p></statement>
    	<answer>False</answer></exercise>
    <exercise number="6"><statement><p>True or False: If both coordinates of a point are negative, the point is located in the lower left quadrant.</p></statement>
    	<answer><p>True</p></answer></exercise>
</reading-questions>

<p>Now we can graph an equation that includes negative values.</p>

<example><statement><p>The temperature in Nome was <m>-12 \degree</m>F at noon. It has been rising at a rate of <m>2 \degree</m>F per hour all day.<ol label="a">  
	<li>Write an equation for the temperature, <m>T</m>, after <m>h</m> hours.</li>
	<li>Fill in the table and graph your equation. (Negative values of <m>h</m> represent hours before noon.)

<p>We can also answer parts (c) and (d) of Example 3 using algebra. For part (c), we evaluate the expression for <m>T</m>, namely <m>-12+2h</m>, at <m>h=-8</m>. For part (d), we solve the equation <m>T=-12+2h</m> with <m>T=-4</m>. Make sure that you understand both methods, graphical and algebraic.</p></assemblage>

<assemblage><title>Graphing Tip #1</title>
<p>If the <term>coefficient</term> of <m>x</m> (the number multiplying <m>x</m>) is a fraction, we can make our work easier by choosing multiples of the denominator for the <m>x</m>-values. That way we won't have to work with fractions to find the <m>y</m>-values. In Example 4, the coefficient of <m>x</m> is <m>\dfrac{-2}{3}</m>, so we choose multiples of 3 for the <m>x</m>-values.</p></assemblage>
