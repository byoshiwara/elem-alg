    <title>Algebraic Expressions</title>

<subsection><title>Writing an Algebraic Expression</title>

<assemblage><p>An <term>algebraic expression</term>, or simply an <term>expression</term>, is any meaningful combination of numbers, variables, and operation symbols.</p></assemblage>

<p>For example,
	<me>4 \times g,~~~~~~3 \times c + p,~~~~~~\text{and}~~~~~~\dfrac{n-7}{w}</me>
are algebraic expressions. An important part of algebra involves translating word phrases into algebraic expressions.</p> 

<example><statement><p>Write an algebraic expression for each quantity.<ol label="a">
	<li>30% of the money invested in stocks</li>
	<li>The cost of the dinner split three ways</li></ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
	<li><p>The amount invested is unknown, so we choose a variable to represent it.
			<me>\blert{\text{Amount invested in stocks:}~~~s}</me>
		Next, we identify the operation described:  "30% of"  means 0.30 times:
			<me>\text{The expression is} ~~~~\blert{0.30s}</me></p></li>
	<li><p>The cost of the dinner is unknown, so we choose a variable to represent it.
			<me>\blert{\text{Cost of dinner:}~~~C}</me>
		Next, we identify the operation described:  "Split" means divided:
			<me>\text{The expression is} ~~~~\blert{\dfrac{C}{3}}</me></p></li>
</ol></p></solution></example>

<reading-questions>
	<exercise number="1"><statement><p>A meaningful combination of numbers, variables and operation symbols is called an <fillin characters="6"/>.</p></statement>

<subsection><title>Sums</title>
<p>When we add two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, the result is called the <term>sum</term> of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. We call the numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> the <term>terms</term> of the sum.</p>
	<sidebyside width="50%"><image source="images/fig-1-2-1.png"/></sidebyside>

<example><statement><p>Write sums to represent the following phrases.<ol label="a" cols="2">
	<li><p>Six more than <m>x</m></p></li>
	<li><p>Fifteen greater than <m>r</m></p></li>
</ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a" cols="2">
	<li><p><m>6+x</m> or <m>x+6</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>15+r</m> or <m>r+15</m></p></li>
</ol></p></solution></example>

<p>The terms can be added in either order.  We call this fact the <term>commutative law</term> for addition.</p>

<assemblage><title>Commutative Law for Addition</title>
	<p>If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are numbers, then
		<me>a+b = b+a</me></p>
</assemblage>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Products</title>
<p>When we multiply two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, the result is called the <term>product</term> of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.  The numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the <term>factors</term> of the product.</p>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>In arithmetic we use the symbol <m>\times</m> to denote multiplication. However, in algebra, <m>\times</m> may be confused with the variable <m>x</m>. So, instead, we use a dot or parentheses for multiplication, like this:
	<sidebyside width="70%"><image source="images/fig-1-2-2.png"/></sidebyside>
If one of the factors is a variable, we can just write the factors side by side. For example,
	\begin{align*}
			ab~~~~\amp \text{means} \amp\amp \text{the product of}~~ a~~ \text{times}~~ b\\ 
			3x~~~~\amp \text{means} \amp\amp \text{the product of}~~ 3~~ \text{times}~~ x\\
	\end{align*}</p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Write products to represent the following phrases.<ol label="a">
	<li>Ten times <m>z</m></li>
	<li>Two-thirds of <m>y</m></li>
	<li>The product of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m></li>
</ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a" cols="3">
	<li><m>10z</m></li>
	<li><m>\dfrac{2}{3}y</m></li>
	<li><m>xy</m> or <m>yx</m></li>
</ol></p></solution></example>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>In Example 3a, <m>10z = 10 \cdot z = z \cdot 10</m>, because two numbers can be multiplied in either order to give the same answer. This is the <term>commutative law</term> for multiplication.</p></assemblage>

<assemblage><title>Commutative Law for Multiplication</title>
<p>If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are numbers, then
		<me>a \cdot b = b \cdot a</me></p>
</assemblage>

<p>In algebra, we usually write products with the numeral first. Thus, we write <m>10z</m> for "<m>10</m> times <m>z</m>‚Äù.</p>

<reading-questions>
	<exercise number="2"><statement><p>When we add two numbers, the result is called the <fillin characters="6"/> and the two numbers are called the <fillin characters="6"/>.</p></statement>
		<answer><p>sum, terms</p></answer></exercise>
	<exercise number="3"><statement><p>When we multiply two numbers, the result is called the <fillin characters="6"/> and the two numbers are called the <fillin characters="6"/>.</p></statement>
		<answer><p>product, factors</p></answer></exercise>
</reading-questions>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Differences</title>
<p>When we subtract <m>b</m> from <m>a</m> the result is called the <term>difference</term> of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. As with addition, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are called <term>terms</term>.</p>
	<sidebyside width="70%"><image source="images/fig-1-2-3.png"/></sidebyside>

<warning><p>The difference <m>5-2</m> is not the same as <m>2-5</m>.  When we translate 
"<m>a</m> subtracted from <m>b</m>," the order of the terms is important.
	\begin{align*}
			b-a~~~~\amp \text{means} \amp\amp a~~ \text{subtracted from}~~ b\\ 
			x-7~~~~\amp \text{means} \amp\amp 7~~ \text{subtracted from}~~  x\\
	\end{align*}
The operation of subtraction is not commutative.</p></warning>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Quotients</title>
<p>When we divide <m>a</m> by <m>b</m> the result is called the <term>quotient</term> of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.  We call <m>a</m> the <term>dividend</term> and <m>b</m> the <term>divisor</term>.  In algebra we indicate division by using the division symbol, <m>\div</m>, or a fraction bar.</p>
	<sidebyside width="80%"><image source="images/fig-1-2-4.png"/></sidebyside>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>The operation of division is not commutative. The order of the numbers in a quotient makes a difference. For example, <m>12 \div 3 = 4</m> but <m>3 \div 12 = \dfrac{1}{4}</m>.</p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Write an algebraic expression for each phrase.<ol label="a" cols="2">
	<li><m>z</m> subtracted from <m>13</m></li>
	<li><m>25</m> divided by <m>R</m></li>
</ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a" cols ="2">
	<li><m>13-z</m></li>
	<li><m>\dfrac{25}{R}</m></li>
</ol></p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Evaluating an Algebraic Expression</title>
<p>An algebraic expression is a pattern or rule for different versions of the situation it describes. We can replace the variable by specific numbers to fit a particular situation.</p>

<assemblage><p>Substituting a specific value into an expression and calculating the result is called <term>evaluating</term> the expression.</p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Fernando has three roommates, and his share of the rent is <m>\dfrac{R}{4}</m>, where <m>R</m> is a variable representing the total rent on the apartment. If Fernando and his roommates find an apartment whose rent is $540, we can find Fernando's share of the rent by replacing <m>R</m> by <m>\alert{540}</m>.
	<me>\dfrac{R}{4} = \alert{540} \div 4 = 135</me>
Fernando's share of the rent is $135.</p></statement></example>

<p>In Example 5, we evaluated the expression <m>\dfrac{R}{4}</m> for <m>R=540</m>.</p>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Some Useful Algebraic Formulas</title>
<p>Here are some examples of common formulas. Formulas may involve several different variables.</p>

<assemblage><p>To find the distance traveled by an object moving at a constant speed or rate for a specified time, we multiply the rate by the time.
	<me>\text{distance} = \text{rate} \times \text{time}~~~~~~~~~~~~~d = rt</me></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>How far will a train moving at 80 miles per hour travel in three hours?</p></statement>
<solution><p>We evaluate the formula with <m>r=\alert{80}</m> and <m>t=\alert{3}</m> to find
	\begin{align*}
		d \amp = rt\\
			\amp = (\alert{80})(\alert{3}) = 240
	\end{align*}
The train will travel 240 miles.</p></solution></example>

<assemblage><p>To find the <term>profit</term> earned by a company we subtract the costs from the revenue.
	<me>\text{profit} = \text{revenue} - \text{cost}~~~~~~~~~~~~~P = R-C</me></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>The owner of a sandwich shop spent $800 last week for labor and supplies. She received $1150 in revenue.  What was her profit?</p></statement>
<solution><p>We evaluate the formula with <m>R=\alert{1150}</m> and <m>C=\alert{800}</m> to find
	\begin{align*}
		P \amp = R-C\\
			\amp = \alert{1150}-\alert{350} = 350
	\end{align*}
The owner's profit was $350.</p></solution></example>

<assemblage><p>To find the <term>interest</term> earned on an investment we multiply the amount invested (the principal) by the interest rate and the length of the investment.
	<me>\text{interest} = \text{principal} \times \text{interest rate} \times \text{time}~~~~~~~~~~~~~I=Prt</me></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>How much interest will be earned on $800 invested for 3 years in a savings account that pays <m>5\dfrac{1}{2}</m>% interest?</p></statement>
<solution><p>We evaluate the formula with <m>P=\alert{800}</m>, <m>r=\alert{0.055}</m>, and <m>t=\alert{3}</m> to find
	\begin{align*}
		I \amp = Prt\\
			\amp = \alert{800} \times \alert{0.055} \times \alert{3} = 132
	\end{align*}
The account will earn $132 in interest.</p></solution></example>

<assemblage><p>To find a percentage or <term>part</term> of a given amount, we multiply the whole amount by the percentage rate.
	<me>\text{part} = \text{percentage rate} \times \text{whole} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~P=rW</me></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>How much ginger ale do you need to make 60 gallons of a fruit punch that is 20% ginger ale?</p></statement>
<solution><p>We evaluate the formula with <m>r=\alert{0.20}</m> and <m>W=\alert{60}</m> to find
	\begin{align*}
		P \amp = rW\\
			\amp = \alert{0.20} \times \alert{60} = 12
	\end{align*}
You would need 12 gallons of ginger ale.</p></solution></example>

<assemblage><p>To find the <term>average</term> of a collection of scores, we divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores.
	<me>\text{average score} = \dfrac{\text{sum of scores}}{\text{number of scores}} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~A=\dfrac{S}{n}</me></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Bert's quiz scores in chemistry are 15, 16, 18, 18, and 12.  What is his average score?</p></statement>
<solution><p>We evaluate the formula with <m>S=\alert{15+16+18+18+12}</m> and <m>n=\alert{5}</m> to find
	\begin{align*}
		A \amp = \dfrac{S}{n}\\
			\amp = \dfrac{\alert{15+16+18+18+12}} {\alert{5}} = 15.8
	\end{align*}
Bert's average score is 15.8.</p></solution></example>
