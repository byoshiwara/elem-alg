<exercise number="1"><statement><p>Goodlife Insurance Company has $150,000 in fees from its clients to invest. They deposited part of the money into bonds that pay 6.5% annual interest and the rest into a mutual fund that pays 11.8% annual interest.<ol label="a">
	<li>Assign variables to the amount of money Goodlife deposited into each account, and write an equation about the sum of the deposits.</li>
	<li>Write expressions for the interest earned on each account after 1 year.</li>
	<li>Goodlife earned $12,930 interest in 1 year. Write an equation about that.</li>
	<li>Solve your system of equations to find out how much Goodlife invested in each account.</li></ol></p></statement>

<exercise number="2"><statement><p>Mario borrowed $30,000 from two banks to open a print shop. The first loan charges 12% annual interest, and the second charges 15% interest. Mario's annual interest payment on both loans together is $3750. How much did he borrow at each rate?<ol label="a">
	<li>Assign variables to the unknown quantities and make a table like the one in <xref ref="Example-4-4-1" text="type-global"/>.</li>
	<li>Write two equations for the problem, one about the principals and one about the interests.</li>
	<li>Solve your system and answer the question in the problem.</li></ol></p></statement></exercise>

<exercise number="3"><statement><p>Stefan borrowed twice as much on his 7% car loan as on his 4% student loan. The annual interest on the car loan is $500 more than the interest on the student loan. How much did Stefan borrow on each loan?</p></statement>
<answer><p>student loan: $5000; car loan: $10,000</p></answer></exercise>
