    <title>Order of Operations</title>

<subsection><title>Addition and Multiplication</title>

<p>If you add together three or more numbers, such as 
	<me>2+5+8</me>
it doesn't matter which addition you do first; you will get the same answer either way.</p>

<example><statement><p><ol label="a">
	<li>A sum of three or more terms can be added in any order. In the sums below, the parentheses tell us which part of the expression to simplify first.  
		\begin{align*}
                (\blert{2} \amp \blert{+5})+8 \amp \text{and}~~~~~~~~~~2 \amp + (\blert{5+8})\\
                \amp = \blert{7}+8=15 \amp		\amp = 2+\blert{13}=15
                \end{align*}</li>
    <li>Similarly, a product of three factors can be multiplied in any order. Thus
    	\begin{align*}
                (\blert{3} \amp \blert{\cdot 2}) \cdot 4 \amp \text{and}~~~~~~~~~~3 \cdot \amp + (\blert{2 \cdot 4})\\
                \amp = \blert{6}\cdot 4=24 \amp		\amp = 3 \cdot \blert{8}=24
                \end{align*}</li></ol></p></statement></example>

<p>These two facts illustrate the associative laws for addition and multiplication.</p>

<assemblage><title>Associative Law for Addition</title>
<p>If <m>a, b</m> and <m>c</m> are any numbers, then
	<me>(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)</me></p></assemblage>

<assemblage><title>Associative Law for Multiplication</title>
<p>If <m>a, b</m> and <m>c</m> are any numbers, then
	<me>(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)</me></p></assemblage>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Subtraction and Division</title>
<p>What about a string of subtractions or a string of divisions, such as
	<me>20-8-5~~~~~~~~~~\text{or}~~~~~~~~~~36 \div 6 \div 2</me>
In these calculations, we get different answers, depending on which operations we perform first, as you can see in Example 2.</p>

<example><statement><p><ol label="a">
	<li>Subtraction:
		<me>(\blert{20-8})-5=\blert{12}-5=7 ~~~~~~\text{but}~~~~~~ 20-(\blert{8-5})=20-\blert(3)=17</me></li>
	<li>Division:
		<me>(\blert{36 \div 6}) \div 2 =\blert{6}\div 2=3 ~~~~~~\text{but}~~~~~~ 36 \div(\blert{6 \div 2})=36-\blert(3)=12</me></li>
	</ol></p></statement></example>

<assemblage><p>The associative laws do not hold for subtraction or division.</p></assemblage>

<p>So, if there are no parentheses in the expression, how do we know which operations to perform first?</p>

<assemblage><p><ol label="1">
	<li>In a string of additions and subtractions, we perform the operations in order from left to right.</li>  
	<li>Similarly, we perform multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.</li>
</ol></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Simplify each expression.<ol label="a" cols="2">
	<li><m>20-8-5</m></li>
	<li><m>36 \div 6 \div 2</m></li></ol></p></statement>
<solution><p>Perform the operations in order from left to right.<ol label="a" cols="2">
	<li><m>\blert{20-8}-5=\blert{12}-5=7</m></li>
	<li><m>\blert{36 \div 6} \div 2 =\blert{6}\div 2=3</m></li></ol></p></solution></example>
