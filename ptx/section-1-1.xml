    <subsection><title>What is a Variable?</title>   
                   
    <assemblage><p>A <term>variable</term> is a numerical quantity that changes over time or in different situations.</p></assemblage>

    <p>We can show the values of a variable in a table or a graph.</p>
                 
    <example><statement>
    <p>Life expectancy is the average age to which people will live.  The table below shows that your life expectancy depends on the year of your birth. Thus, life expectancy is a variable.</p>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>By displaying the values of a variable in a table or a graph, we sometimes see trends or patterns in those values.  For example, we see that life expectancy has been increasing slowly over time, and that salaries of NFL football players have been increasing ever more rapidly since 1940.</p></assemblage>

<p>We often use a letter as a kind of short-hand to represent a variable. For this example, we use the following letters:  
    <me>t~~~  \text{stands for the time elapsed after take-off}</me>
    <me>h~~~  \text{stands for the plane's altitude at that time}</me></p>

<p>We can get a better feel for the variables by plotting them on a graph. In the figure below, the values of <m>t</m> are displayed on the horizontal scale, or axis, and the values of <m>h</m> are shown on the vertical axis. The graph shows how the values of <m>h</m> are related to the values of <m>t</m>.</p>
