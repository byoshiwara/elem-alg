    <title>Graphing Quadratic Equations</title>

<subsection><title><m>x</m>-Intercepts of a Parabola</title>
<p>So far we have graphed quadratic equations by plotting points. But we can use some algebraic techniques to make the process easier.</p>
<p>In Lesson 6.2 we saw that the solutions of the equation
	<me>40p=p^2=0</me>
namely, <m>p=0</m> and <m>p=40</m>, are also the horizontal intercepts of the graph of  
	<me>R=40p-p^2</me>
This is the same connection we saw between the <m>x</m>-intercepts of a line and the solutions of its equation. Recall that the <m>x</m>-intercept of the line <m>y=mx+b</m> is the point where the graph crosses the <m>x</m>-axis. To find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of a line, we set <m>y=0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>. The same strategy applies to quadratic equations.</p>

<assemblage><title><m>x</m>-Intercepts of a Parabola</title>
<p>	To find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph of
	<me>y=ax^2+bx+c</me> 
we set <m>y=0</m> and solve the equation
	<me>ax^2+bx+c=0</me></p></assemblage>

<subsection><title>The Vertex</title>
<p>The graph of a quadratic equation <m>y=ax^2+bx+c</m> is a smooth curve, called a parabola, that bends upwards or downwards.</p> 
	
	<assemblage><p>The high or low point of a parabola is called its <term>vertex</term>.</p></assemblage> 

<sidebyside widths="50% 30%" valigns="middle middle"><p>Look again at the graph of <m>y=4x-x^2</m> from Example 1, shown at right. Notice that the graph is symmetric about a vertical line (called the <term>axis of symmetry</term>) that passes through the vertex. All the parabolas we'll study have a vertical axis of symmetry.</p>   
	<image source="images/fig-6-4-1.png"><description>parabola</description></image></sidebyside>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>Because of this symmetry, the <m>x</m>-intercepts are located at equal distances on either side of the axis of symmetry. Or we can say that the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the vertex is exactly halfway between the two <m>x</m>-intercepts.</p></assemblage>

<assemblage><p>We can locate the vertex of a parabola by taking the average of its <m>x</m>-intercepts.</p></assemblage>

    <exercise number="2"><statement><p>What is the vertex of a parabola?</p></statement>
    <answer><p>The high or low point</p></answer></exercise>
</reading-questions>

<example><statement><p>Find the vertex of the graph of <m>y=4x-x^2.</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>In Example 1 we found that the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph are <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=4</m>. The <m>x</m>-coordinate of the vertex is the average of these two numbers.
	<me>x=\dfrac{0+4}{2}</me>
The <m>x</m>-coordinate of the vertex is <m>x=2</m>. To find the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute <m>x=\alert{2}</m> into the equation of the parabola.
<me>y=4(\alert{2})-\alert{2}^2=8-4=4</me>
The coordinates of the vertex are <m>(2,4)</m>, as you can see in the graph above.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Graphing Parabolas</title>
<p>By locating the <m>x</m>-intercepts and the vertex of the graph, we can make a quick sketch of a parabola.</p>

<example><statement><p>Sketch a graph of  <m>~y=x^2-8x+7</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>First we find the <m>x</m>-intercepts: we substitute <m>y=0</m> into the equation, and solve for <m>x</m>.
		<md><mrow>x^2-8x+7 \amp =0 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Factor the left side.}}</mrow>
				<mrow>(x-7)(x-1) \amp =0 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Set each factor equal to 0.}}</mrow>
				<mrow>x-7=0~~~~x-1 \amp = 0  \amp \amp \blert{\text{Solve each equation.}}</mrow>
				<mrow>x = 7~~~~x \amp = 1</mrow></md></p>
<p>The <m>x</m>-intercepts are the points <m>(7,0)</m> and <m>(1,0)</m>. Next, we locate the vertex of the graph. The <m>x</m>-coordinate of the vertex is the average of the <m>x</m>-intercepts, so
	<me>x=\dfrac{1+7}{2}=4</me>
You can check that <m>x=4</m> is halfway between the two <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph shown in the figure. To find the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the vertex, we evaluate the formula for the parabola at<m>x=\alert{4}</m>.
		<md><mrow>y \amp = \alert{4}^2-8(\alert{4})+7</mrow>
			<mrow> \amp = 16-32+7=-9</mrow></md></p>
<sidebyside widths="50% 40%"><p>The vertex of the parabola is the point <m>(4,-9)</m>. We can also find the <m>y</m>-intercept of the graph by substituting <m>x=\alert{0}</m> into the equation. 
	<me>\alert{0}^2-8(\alert{0})+7=7</me>
The <m>y</m>-intercept is the point <m>0,7</m>. We plot the vertex and the intercepts and draw a smooth curve through them. The completed graph is shown above.</p>
