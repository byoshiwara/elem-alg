<p>A rectangle with this property is called a golden rectangle, and the ratio of its length to its width is called the golden ratio. The golden ratio appears frequently in art and nature, and is considered to give the most pleasing proportions to many figures. We'll compute the golden ratio as follows.<ol label="a">
	<li>Let <m>AB=1</m> and <m>AD=x</m>. What are the lengths of <m>AE,~ ED,</m> and <m>CD</m>?</li>
	<li>Write a proportion in terms of <m>x</m> for the similarity of rectangles <m>ABCD</m> and <m>CDEF</m>. Be careful to match up the corresponding sides.</li>
	<li>Solve your proportion for <m>x</m>. Find the golden ratio, <m>\dfrac{AD}{AB} = \dfrac{x}{1}.</m></li></ol>
