    <title>Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring</title>

<subsection><title>The Zero-Factor Principle</title>
<p>	In Lesson 6.2 we applied the Zero-Factor Principle to solve quadratic equations of the form  <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m>.  For reference, here is the statement of the Zero-Factor Principle.</p>  

	<assemblage><title>Zero-Factor Principle</title>
<p>	If the product of two numbers is zero, then one (or both) of the numbers must be zero.  Using symbols,
	<me>\text{If}~AB=0,~\text{then either} ~A=0~\text{or}~B=0.</me></p></assemblage>

<p>In order to solve more general quadratic equations, of the form <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m> we will need to factor quadratic trinomials.  Here is an example of how we can use the principle to solve a quadratic equation.</p>

<example xml:id="Example-6-3-1"><statement><p><ol label="a">
	<li>Compute the product  <m>~(x+5)(x-4).</m></li>
	<li>Solve the equation  <m>~x^2+x-20=0.</m></li></ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
	<li>We use the FOIL method to apply the distributive law to the product.
		<sidebyside width="50%"><image source="images/fig-6-3-ex1"><description>graphic</description></image></sidebyside></li>
	<li>From part (a) we see that <m>~x^2+x-20</m> can also be written in factored form as <m>~(x+5)(x-4)</m>. Thus, the equation <m>~x^2+x-20</m> is equivalent to
		<me>(x+5)(x-4)=0</me>
	We can apply the Zero-Factor Principle to this equation: If the product is zero, then one of the factors must be zero. Thus, either
		<me>x+5=0~~~~\text{or}~~~~x-4=0</me>
	This means that either <m>x=-5</m> or <m>x=4</m>. These are the solutions of the equation, as we verify below.

<subsection><title>Factoring Quadratic Trinomials</title>
<p>In Lesson 6.2 we learned to factor quadratic expressions of the form <m>ax^2+bx</m>. Now we consider quadratic trinomials of the form <m>x^2+bx+c</m>. Many of these can be factored into the product of two binomials. For example,
	<me>x^2+7x+12=(x+3)(x+4)</me></p>
<p>How can we come up with the factors of the quadratic trinomial? Let's recall how the product is obtained. We apply the distributive law and multiply each term of the first binomial by each term of the second binomial. We use the word "FOIL" to label the four terms of the product: First, Outside, Inside, and Last.</p>

<reading-questions>
    <exercise number="2"><statement><p>Where does the constant term of the trinomial appear in the product box?
</p></statement>
    	<answer><p>In the lower left-hand box.</p></answer></exercise>
    <exercise number="3"><statement><p>Where does the linear term appear?</p></statement>

</reading-questions>

<p>We make several observations about this product.</p>
    
<assemblage><p><ol label="1">
	<li>The quadratic term, <m>x^2</m>, comes from the product of the First terms in each binomial.</li>  
	<li>The constant term, <m>12</m>, is the product of the Last terms.</li>  
	<li>The middle term, <m>7x</m>, is the sum of two terms, the product of the Inside terms and the product of the Outside terms.</li></ol></p></assemblage>

<p>We can see that the first term of each factor must be <m>x</m>, so we only need to fill in the blanks below with the correct numbers:                    
	<me>x^2+7x+12=(x+<fillin characters="6"/>)(x+<fillin characters="6"/>)</me>
If the two numbers are <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>, then
	<md><mrow>(x+p)(x+q)\amp =x^2+qx+px+pq</mrow>
		<mrow> \amp x^2 + (\blert{p+q})x + \blert{pq}</mrow></md>
We see that the constant term of the trinomial is the product <m>pq</m>, and the linear term of the trinomial has as coefficient the sum <m>p+q</m>.</p>  
	
<p>Thus, to factor <m>x^2+7x+12</m>, we look for two integers <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> whose sum is 7 and whose product is 12.  With a little trial and error, we discover that the two integers are 3 and 4. So the factored form is 
	<me>x^2+7x+12=(x+3)(x+4)</me></p>

<assemblage><title>To Factor a Quadratic Trinomial</title>
<p>	To factor <m>x^2+bx+c</m>, we look for two numbers <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> so that   
		<me>\blert{pq=c}~~~~\text{and}~~~~\blert{p+q=b}</me></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Factor  <m>~~a^2+13a+40</m></p></statement>
<solution><p>The factored form looks like   
	<me>a^2+13a+40=(a+p)(a+q)</me>
where <m>pq=40</m> and <m>p+q=13</m>. To find the numbers <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>, it may help to list all possible pairs of numbers whose product is 40. Then we can check each pair of numbers to see which pair has a sum of 13.

<p>We see that <m>5 \cdot 8 = 40</m> and <m>5+8=13</m>, so the correct factorization is

 We can also write the factored form as <m>(a+8)(a+5)</m>;  the order of the factors does not matter. Aside from rearranging the factors, there is only one correct factorization for these quadratic trinomials.</p></solution></example>

<p>In the Activities we'll see how to factor trinomials with negative coefficients. Here are the results.</p></assemblage>

<assemblage><title>Sign Patterns for Factoring Quadratic Trinomials</title>
<p>Assume that <m>b,~c,~p,</m> and <m>q</m> are positive integers.<ol label="1">  
	<li><p><m>x^2+bx+c=(x+p)(x+q)</m></p>	
	<p>If all the coefficients of the trinomial are positive, then both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are positive.</p></li>
	<li><p><m>x^2-bx+c=(x-p)(x-q)</m></p>
	<p>If the linear term of the trinomial is negative and the other two terms positive, then <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are both negative.</p></li>  
	<li><p><m>x^2 \pm bx+c=(x+p)(x-q)</m></p>
	<p>If the constant term of the trinomial is negative, then <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> have opposite signs.</p></li>
</ol></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Factor  <m>~x^2+3x-18</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>We look for two integers <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> for which <m>pq=-18</m> and <m>p+q=3</m>. Because <m>pq</m> is negative, <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> must have opposite signs.  Because <m>p+q</m> is positive, the choices are
	<me>-1~\text{and}~18,~~~~-2~\text{and}~9,~~~~\text{or}~~~~-3~\text{and}~6</me>
Because <m>-3+6=3</m>, the correct factorization is
	<me>x^2+3x-18=(x-3)(x+6)</me>
You can check the factorization by multiplying the two binomials to see that their product is in fact <m>~x^2+3x-18</m>.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Solving a Quadratic Equation</title>
<p>	Now we can use factoring to solve a quadratic equation.</p>

<example xml:id="Example-6-3-4"><statement><p>Solve the equation <m>~x^2+3x=18</m></p></statement>
<solution><p>We must have the right side equal to zero if we want to apply the Zero-Factor Principle, so we begin by subtracting 18 from both sides to get

The solutions are <m>-6</m> and <m>3</m>. You can check that each of these solutions satisfies the original equation.</p></solution></example>

<warning><p>Before factoring and applying the Zero-Factor Principle, we must write the equation in standard form, so that one side of the equation is zero.  Thus, it would not be useful to write

We cannot apply the Zero-Factor principle to this equation.</p></warning>

<p>Here is our method for solving a quadratic equation by factoring.</p>

<assemblage><title>To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Factoring</title><p><ol label="1">
	<li>Write the equation in standard form, 
		<me>ax^2+bx+c=0~~~~~~(a \not= 0)</me></li>       
	<li>Factor the left side of the equation.</li>
	<li>Apply the Zero-Factor Principle; that is, set each factor equal to zero.</li>
	<li>Solve each equation to obtain two solutions.</li></ol></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Solve the equation <m>~2x^2+6x=36</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>You may notice that each term of this equation is twice the corresponding term of the equation in <xref ref="Example-6-3-4" text="type-global"/>.  We can factor out a common factor of 2 from the left side of the standard form of this equation.
	<md><mrow>2x^2+6x-36 \amp =0 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Factor out 2 from the left side.}}</mrow>
		<mrow>2(x^2+3x-18) \amp = 0</mrow></md>
Then we can divide both sides of the equation by 2.  
	<md><mrow>\dfrac{2(x^2+3x-18)}{\blert{2}} \amp = \dfrac{0}{\blert{2}}</mrow>
		<mrow>x^2+3x-18 \amp = 0</mrow></md>
This new equation is the same as the equation in <xref ref="Example-6-3-4" text="type-global"/>. Thus, the solutions are the same as the solutions in <xref ref="Example-6-3-4" text="type-global"/>, namely, <m>-6</m> and <m>3</m>.</p></solution></example>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>Multiplying the equation in <xref ref="Example-6-3-4" text="type-global"/> by a factor of 2 does not affect the solutions of the equation. We can divide both sides of a quadratic (or any) equation by a nonzero constant factor while solving.</p></assemblage>

<p>From the graph, we see that it takes the book 5 seconds to reach the ground. Because <m>h=0</m> when the book reaches the ground, 5 is one of the solutions of the quadratic equation 
	<me>0=-16t^2+32t+240</me>
Can we solve this equation algebraically, without using a graph?</p>

<example xml:id="Example-6-3-6"><statement><p> The equation

<solution><p>We set <m>h=0</m> to obtain the equation
