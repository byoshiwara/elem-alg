<p>or <m>m=0.4</m> degrees per minute.</p>
<p> You can see from either the table or the graph that the <m>y</m>-intercept is the point <m>(0,70)</m>. This means that the initial temperature inside the drying oven was 70 degrees.</p>

<assemblage><title>Look Ahead</title>
<p>If we know two pieces of information about a line: its slope and its initial value or <m>y</m>-intercept, we can write its equation.</p></assemblage>

<example xml:id="Example-3-4-1"><statement><p>Write an equation for the temperature, <m>H</m>, inside the pottery drying oven <m>t</m> minutes after the oven is turned on.</p></statement>

<solution><p>The initial temperature in the oven was 70 degrees, so <m>H=70</m> when <m>t=0</m>. The temperature rose at a rate of 0.4 degrees per minute, so we add 0.4 degrees to <m>H</m> for each minute that passes. After <m>t</m> minutes, we have added <m>0.4t</m> degrees, giving us a temperature of
	<me>H = 70 + 0.4t</me>
We can also write the equation as  <m>H=0.4t+70</m>.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Slope-Intercept Method of Graphing</title>
<p>A linear equation has the form <m>Ax+By=C</m>, and its graph is a straight line.  We have already studied two methods for graphing linear equations:<ol label="1">  
	<li>Make a table of values and plot points</li>  
	<li>Find and plot the intercepts (the intercept method)</li></ol></p>

<p>There is a third graphing method that makes use of the slope of the line. We can use the slope-intercept form to sketch a graph quickly, without having to plot a lot of points.</p>

<example xml:id="Example-3-4-2"><statement><p>Graph the equation <m>~y=\dfrac{3}{4}x-2</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>The slope of the line is <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> and its <m>y</m>-intercept is the point <m>(0,-2)</m>. We begin by plotting the <m>y</m>-intercept, as shown in the figure. Next, we use the slope to find another point on the line.

The slope,
	<me>m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{3}{4}</me>
gives the ratio of the change in <m>y</m>-coordinate to the change in <m>x</m>-coordinate as we move from any point on the line to another. Thus, starting at the point <m>(0,-2)</m>, we move: <ul>
	<li>3 units up (the positive <m>y</m>-direction),then</li>
	<li>4 units right (the positive <m>x</m>-direction )</li></ul>
to locate another point on the line. The coordinates of this new point are <m>(4,1)</m>. Finally,we draw a line through the two points, as shown in the figure.</p></solution></example>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>To improve the accuracy of the graph in <xref ref="Example-3-4-2" text="type-global"/>, we can find a third point on the line by writing the slope in an equivalent form. We change the sign of both numerator and denominator of the slope to get  
	<me>m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{-3}{-4}</me>
Starting again from the <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,-2)</m>, we now move 3 units down and 4 units left, and find the point <m>(-4,-5)</m> on the graph.</p></assemblage>

<subsection><title>Finding the Slope-Intercept Form</title>
<p>Not all linear equations appear in slope-intercept form. However, we can write the equation of any non-vertical line in slope-intercept form by solving the equation for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.</p>

<example><statement><p>Find the slope and <m>y</m>-intercept of the graph of <m>~3x-4y=8</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>To write the equation in slope-intercept form, we solve for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.
 	<me>\begin{aligned}
                3x-4y \amp = 8 \amp\amp \blert{\text{Subtract}~ 3x ~ \text{from both sides.}}\\
                -4y \amp = -3x+8 \amp\amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by} ~-4.}\\
                \dfrac{-4y}{-4} \amp = \dfrac{-3x+8}{-4} \amp\amp \blert{\text{Divide each term of the right side by} ~-4.}\\ 
                y \amp = \dfrac{-3x}{-4}+\dfrac{-8}{-4} \amp\amp \blert{\text{Simplify each quotient.}}\\
                y \amp = \dfrac{3}{4}x-2                
                \end{aligned}</me>
The equation is now in slope-intercept form, with <m>m= \dfrac{3}{4}</m> and <m>b=-2</m>. Thus, the slope of the graph is <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> and the <m>y</m>-intercept is the point <m>(0,-2)</m>.</p></solution></example>

<warning><p>Do not confuse solving for <m>y</m> with finding the <m>y</m>-intercept. In the Example above, we do not set <m>x=0</m> before solving for <m>y</m>. <ul> 
	<li>When we find the <m>y</m>-intercept, we are looking for a specific point, namely, the point with <m>x</m>-coordinate zero, so we replace <m>x</m> by 0.</li>
	<li> When we "solve for <m>y</m>," we are writing the equation in another form, so both variables, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, still appear in the equation.</li></ul></p></warning>
