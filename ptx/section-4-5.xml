    <title>Point-Slope Formula</title>

<subsection><title>Finding an Equation for a Line</title>
<p>The slope of a line is the same, no matter which points we use to compute it. Therefore, if we know the slope  of a line and any one point  on the line, then all other points on the line must satisfy the slope formula:
	<me>\blert{\dfrac{y-y_1}{x-x_1} = m}</me>
This is, in fact, an equation for the line.</p>

<example><statement><p><ol label="a">
	<li>Graph the line that passes through the point <m>(1,3)</m> and has slope <m>-2</m>.</li> 
	<li>Find an equation for the line that passes through the point <m>(1,3)</m> and has slope <m>-2</m>.</li></ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
	<li><p>We plot the point <m>(1,3)</m>, then use the slope, <m>-2</m>, to find another point on the line. From the point <m>(1,3)</m>, we move 2 units down and 1 unit to the right, arriving at <m>(-1,4)</m>. We draw the line through these two points.  The graph is shown below.</p>
	<sidebyside width="50%"><image source="images/fig-4-5-ex1.png"><description>graph</description></image></sidebyside></li>
	<li><p>We use the formula 
		<me>\dfrac{y-y_1}{x-x_1} = m</me>	
	with <m>\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\dfrac{-2}{1}</m> and <m>(x_1,y_1)=(\alert{1},\alert{3})</m> to get
		<me>\dfrac{-2}{1}=\dfrac{y-\alert{3}}{x-\alert{1}}</me>
	 To simplify the equation, we cross-multiply.
	 	<me>\begin{aligned}
                1(y-3) \amp = -2(x-1) \amp\amp \blert{\text{Apply the distributive law.}}\\
                y-3\amp = -2x+2 \amp\amp \blert{\text{Add 3 to both sides.}}\\ 
                y \amp = -2x+5               
                \end{aligned}</me>
    You can verify on the graph that <m>y=-2x+5</m> is an equation for the line.</p></li></ol></p></solution></example>

<p>In Example 1 we used the slope formula in a new way: to find the equation of a line. We can simplify the formula by clearing the denominator.
	<me>\blert{(x-x_1)}\dfrac{y-y_1}{x-x_1} = m\blert{(x-x_1)}</me>
to get  
	<me>y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)</me>
We call this the <term>point-slope formula</term> for linear equations.</p>

<assemblage><title>Point-Slope Formula</title>
<p>To find an equation for the line of slope <m>m</m> passing through the point <m>(x_1,y_1)</m>, we use the <term>point-slope formula</term>
<me>\blert{\dfrac{y-y_1}{x-x_1} = m}</me>  
or
<me>\blert{y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)}</me></p></assemblage>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>What is the difference between the slope formula and the point-slope formula? 
		<me>\begin{aligned}
                \text{the slope formula} \amp  \amp\amp m=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\
                \text{the point-slope formula}\amp  \amp\amp m=\dfrac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}
                \end{aligned}</me></p>
<p>They are really the same formula, but they are used for different purposes:<ul>
	<li>We use the slope formula to calculate the slope of a line when we know two points on the line. That is, we know <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, and we are looking for <m>m</m>.</li>
	<li>We use the point-slope formula to find the equation of a line. That is, we know <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>m</m>, and we are looking for <m>y=mx+b</m>.</li></ul></p></assemblage>

</reading-questions>

<example><statement><p>Find an equation for the line that passes through the point <m>(1,4)</m> and is perpendicular to the line <m>4x-2y=6</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>We know one point on the required line, but we also need to know its slope. Now, our line is perpendicular to the given line, and the slope of the given line is <m>~m_1=2~</m> (as you can check by putting its equation into slope-intercept form). So the slope of our line is 
	<me>m_2=\dfrac{-1}{m_1} = \dfrac{-1}{2}</me> 
Now we can use the point-slope formula with <m>~m_1=\dfrac{-1}{2}</m> and <m>(x_1,y_1) = (1,4)</m>.
	<me>\begin{aligned}
                y-y_1 \amp = m(x-x_1) \\
                y-\alert{4}\amp = \alert{\dfrac{-1}{2}}(x-\alert{1}) \amp\amp \blert{\text{Apply the distributive law.}}\\ 
                y - 4 \amp = \dfrac{-1}{2}x + \dfrac{1}{2}  \amp\amp \blert{\text{Add 4 to both sides.}}\\ 
                y \amp = -\dfrac{-1}{2}x + \dfrac{9}{2}  \amp\amp \blert{\dfrac{1}{2}+4=\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{8}{2}= \dfrac{9}{2}}        
                \end{aligned}</me>
The given line and the perpendicular line are shown in the figure.

</p></solution></example>

<warning><p>If we happen to know the <m>y</m>-intercept of a line, we can write its equation using the slope-intercept formula, <m>y=mx+b</m>. But if we don't know the <m>y</m>-intercept and instead know a different point, it is easier to use the point-slope formula.</p></warning>

<subsection><title>The Line Through Two Points</title>
<p>How many lines pass through two given points? There is only one. We can use the point-slope formula to can find its equation.</p>

<example><statement><p>Find an equation for the line that passes through <m>(2,-1)</m> and <m>(-1,3)</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>We solve this problem in two steps:  First, we find the slope of the line, and then we use the point-slope formula.</p>
<p>Step 1 Let <m>(x_1,y_1) = (2,-1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2) = (-1,3)</m>.  Using the slope formula, we find
		<me>\begin{aligned}
                m \amp =\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\
                \amp =\dfrac{3-(-1)}{-1-2} = \dfrac{4}{-3} = \dfrac{-4}{3}
                \end{aligned}</me></p>

<p>Step 2 We apply the point-slope formula with <m>m=\dfrac{-4}{3}</m> and <m>(x_1,y_1) = (2,-1)</m>. (We can use either point to find the equation of the line.) Then
	<me>\dfrac{y-y_1}{x-x_1} = m~~~~~~\text{becomes} ~~~~~~ \dfrac{y-(-1)}{x-2} = \dfrac{-4}{3}</me>
We cross-multiply to find 
		<me>\begin{aligned}
                3(y+1)\amp = -4(x-2) \amp\amp \blert{\text{Apply the distributive law.}}\\ 
                3y+3 \amp = -4x+8  \amp\amp \blert{\text{Solve for}~y.}\\ 
                3y \amp = -4x+5 \\
                y \amp = \dfrac{-4}{3}x+\dfrac{5}{3}        
                \end{aligned}</me>
The graph of the line is shown in the figure.</p>

<subsection><title>Applications</title>
<p>Variables that increase or decrease at a constant rate can be described by linear equations.</p>

<example><statement><p>In 1993, Americans drank 188.6 million cases of wine. Wine consumption increased at a constant rate over the next decade, and in 2003 we drank 258.3 million cases of wine. 		(Source: LA Times, Adams Beverage Group)
<ol label="a">
	<li>Find a formula for wine consumption, <m>W</m>, in millions of cases, <m>t</m> years after 1990.</li>  
	<li>State the slope as a rate of change. What does the slope tell us about this problem?</li></ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
	<li><p>We have two data points of the form <m>(t,W)</m>, namely <m>(t_1,W_1)=(3,188.6)</m> and <m>(t_2,W_2)=(13,258.3)</m>. We use the point slope formula to fit a line through these two points. First we compute the slope.
		<me>\dfrac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}=\dfrac{W_2-W_2}{t+2-t_1}=\dfrac{258.3-188.6}{13-3}=6.97</me>
	Next, we substitute the slope <m>m=6.97</m> and either of the two data points into the point-slope formula.
		<me>\begin{aligned}
                W \amp = W_1+m(t-t_1)\\
                W \amp = 188.6+6.97(t-3)\\
                W \amp = 167.69+6.97t
                \end{aligned}</me>
    Thus, <m>W = 167.69+6.97t</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>The slope gives us the rate of change of <m>W</m> with respect to <m>t</m>. The units of the variables can help us interpret the slope in context.  
    	<me>\dfrac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}=\dfrac{258.3-188.6~\text{millions of cases}}{13-3~\text{years}} = 6.97~ \text{millions of cases/years}</me>
     Over the ten years between 1993 and 2003, wine consumption in the US increased at a rate of 6.97 million cases per year.</p></li></ol></p></solution></example>
