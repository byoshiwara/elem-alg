    <title>Chapter 1 Summary and Review</title>

<subsection><title>Lesson 1.1 Variables</title><p><ul>
	<li>A <term>variable</term> is a numerical quantity that changes over time or in different situations.</li>  
	<li>We can use a table, a graph, or an equation to compare the values of two related variables.</li>
	<li>A formula relating two variables is a type of <term>equation</term>, and an equation is just a statement that two quantities are equal.</li>
</ul></p></subsection>

<subsection><title>Lesson 1.2 Algebraic Expressions</title><p><ul>
	<li>An <term>algebraic expression</term> is any meaningful combination of numbers, variables, and operation symbols.</li>
	<li><assemblage><title>Commutative Laws</title>
	<p>Addition:  If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are numbers, then
        <me>a+b = b+a</me></p>
    <p>Multiplication:  If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are numbers, then
        <me>a \cdot b = b \cdot a</me></p></assemblage></li>

    <li>Subtraction and division are not commutative; the order of the numbers matters in a difference or a quotient.</li>
    <li><assemblage><title>To write an algebraic expression</title><p><ol label="1">
    	<li>Identify the unknown quantity and write a short phrase to describe it</li>
    	<li>Choose a variable to represent the unknown quantity.</li>
    	<li>Use mathematical symbols to represent the relationship.</li></ol></p></assemblage></li>

   	<li>The process of substituting a specific value for the variable into an expression is called <term>evaluating</term> the expression.</li>
	<li>An equation is a mathematical statement that two algebraic expressions are equal. A <term>formula</term> is an equation that relates two or more variables.</li>

<subsection><title>Lesson 1.3 Equations and Graphs</title><p><ul>
	<li>A <term>graph</term> is a way of visualizing an algebraic equation in two variables. The first or <term>input</term> variable is displayed on the horizontal axis and the second or <term>output</term> variable is displayed on the vertical axis.</li>  
	<li>Each point on a graph has two <term>coordinates</term>, which designate the position of the point.</li>
	<li>An ordered pair of numbers that make an equation true is called a <term>solution</term> of the equation. Each point on the graph of an equation represents a solution of the equation.</li>
	<li>If the variables in an equation have very large (or very small) values, we must choose scales for the axes that fit these values.</li>
	<li><assemblage><title>To graph an equation:</title><p><ol label="1">
    	<li>Make a table of values.</li>
    	<li>Choose scales for the axes.</li>
    	<li>Plot the points and connect them with a smooth curve.</li></ol></p></assemblage></li>
    <li>We can use a graph to evaluate an algebraic expression or to solve an equation.</li>
</ul></p></subsection>

<subsection><title>Lesson 1.4 Solving Equations</title><p><ul>
	<li>To solve an equation algebraically, we use <term>inverse</term>, or opposite, operations.</li>
	<li><assemblage><title>To solve an equation algebraically</title><p><ol label="1">
		<li>Ask yourself what operation has been performed on the variable.</li>
		<li>Perform the opposite operation on both sides of the equation in order to isolate the variable.</li>
		</ol></p></assemblage></li>
	<li><assemblage><title>Operations for solving an equation</title><p><ol label="1">
		<li>We can add or subtract the same number from both sides.</li>
		<li>We can multiply or divide both sides by the same number, as long as 
		that number is not zero.</li></ol></p></assemblage></li>
	<li><assemblage><title>Properties of Equality</title><p><ul>
		<li>If the same quantity is added to or subtracted from both sides of an equation, the solution is unchanged. In symbols,
			<me>\text{If}~~a=b,~~ \text{then}~~a+c=b+c~~\text{and}~~a-c=b-c</me></li> 
		<li>If both sides of an equation are multiplied or divided by the same nonzero quantity, the solution is unchanged. In symbols,
			<me>\text{If}~~a=b,~~ \text{then}~~ac=bc~~\text{and}~~\dfrac{a}{c}=\dfrac{b}{c},~~c\not=0</me></li></ul></p></assemblage></li>
	<li>Many practical problems can be solved by first writing an equation that describes or <term>models</term> the problem, and then solving the equation.</li>
	<li><assemblage><title>Steps for solving an applied problem:</title><p><ol label="1">
		<li>Identify the unknown quantity and choose a variable to represent it.</li>
		<li>Find some quantity that can be described in two different ways, and write an equation using the variable to model the problem situation.</li>
		<li>Solve the equation and answer the question in the problem.</li></ol></p></assemblage></li></ul></p>

<subsection><title>Lesson 1.5 Order of Operations</title><p><ul>
	<li><assemblage><title>Associative Laws</title><p><ul>
		<li>Addition:  If <m>a, b</m> and <m>c</m> are any numbers, then
			<me>(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)</me></li>
		<li>Multiplication:  If <m>a, b</m> and <m>c</m> are any numbers, then
			<me>(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)</me></li></ul></p></assemblage></li>
	<li>The associative laws do not hold for subtraction or division.</li>
	<li><assemblage><title>Order of Operations</title><p><ol label="1">
		<li>First, perform any operations that appear inside parentheses, or above or below a fraction bar.</li>
		<li>Next, perform all multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.</li>
		<li>Finally, perform all additions and subtractions in order from left to right.</li></ol></p></assemblage></li>
	<li>When using a calculator, you must enclose in parentheses any expression that appears above or below a fraction bar.</li></ul></p></subsection>
