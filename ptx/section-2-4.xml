    <title>Linear Equations and Inequalities</title>

<subsection><title>Solving Equations</title>
<p>We solve an equation by isolating the variable on one side of the equation. If an equation involves two or more operations, we must undo those operations in reverse order.</p>

<example><statement><p>The expression <m>T=50+15u</m> describes college tuition consisting of a $50 registration fee plus $15 per unit. How many units can you take if you have $290 saved for tuition?</p></statement>

<solution><p>We can answer the question by solving the equation
	<me>\alert{290}=50+15u</me>
where we have substituted $290 for the tuition, <m>T</m>. Think about the expression <m>50+15u</m>. How would you evaluate this expression if you were given a value for <m>u</m>? Following the order of operations, you would
	<me>\begin{aligned}
                \amp 1.~~~\text{first multiply by 15}\\
                \amp 2.~~~\text{then add 50}   
                \end{aligned}</me>

In order to solve the equation, we must reverse these two steps to undo the operations and isolate the variable.  We first subtract 50 from both sides of the equation: 
		<me>\begin{aligned}
                290 \amp = ~~~~50+15u \amp \amp  \blert{\text{Subtract 50 from both sides.}}\\
                \blert{-50}  \amp = \blert{-50}\\
                240  \amp = ~~~~~~~~~~15u   
                \end{aligned}</me>
                                            
This isolates the term that contains the variable, <m>15u</m>. Then we divide both sides of the equation by 15. 
 		<me>\begin{aligned}
                \dfrac{240}{\blert{15}} \amp = \dfrac{15u}{\blert{15}} \amp \amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by 15.}}\\
                16  \amp = u   
                \end{aligned}</me>                            

You can enroll in 16 units. We can check the solution by substituting 16 for <m>u</m> in the original equation.
		<me>\begin{aligned}
            \blert{\text{Check:}}~~~~~~~~~~~~    50+15u =\amp 290\\
                50+15(\alert{16}) =\amp 50+240=290 ~~~~~ \blert{\text{True}}   
                \end{aligned}</me>
                    
Because a true statement results, the solution checks.</p></solution></example>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>In Example 1, notice how we reversed the operations used in the equation.
		<me>\begin{aligned}
                \amp \text{Operations performed on}~u \amp \amp \text{Steps for solution}\\
                \amp 1.~~~\text{Multiply by 15}  \amp \amp 1.~~~\text{Subtract 50}\\
                \amp 2.~~~\text{Add 50}  \amp \amp 2.~~~\text{Divide by 15}
                \end{aligned}</me></p></assemblage>

<assemblage><title>Strategy for solving equations</title>
<p>To solve an equation that involves two or more operations, we undo those operations in reverse order.</p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Solve <m>~8-3x=-10</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>The left side of the equation has two terms: <m>8</m> and <m>-3x</m>. We want to isolate the term containing the variable, so we subtract 8 from both sides.
		<me>\begin{aligned}
                8-3x \amp = -10 \amp \amp  \blert{\text{Subtract 8 from both sides.}}\\
                \blert{-8}  \amp = \blert{-8}\\
                -3x \amp = -18   
                \end{aligned}</me>
Next, we divide both sides by <m>-3</m> to get
		<me>\begin{aligned}
                \dfrac{-3x}{\blert{-3}} \amp = \dfrac{-18}{\blert{-3}} \amp \amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by}~-3.}\\
                x \amp = 6   
                \end{aligned}</me>
The solutions is 6.
	<me>\blert{\text{Check:}}~~~~~~~~8-3(\alert{6})=8-18=-10</me></p></solution></example>   

<warning><p>In Example 2, the term <m>-3x</m> means "<m>-3</m> times <m>x</m>," so we divide both sides by <m>-3</m>. Do not try to add 3 to both sides.</p></warning>

<subsection><title>Applied Problems</title>
<p>Problem solving often involves signed numbers, either in the equation that models the problem or in its solution, or both.</p>

<example><statement><p>The trout population in Clear Lake is decreasing by approximately 60 fish per year, and this year there are about 430 trout in the lake. If the population drops to 100, the Park Service will have to restock the lake.<ol label="a">
    <li>Write an equation for the population <m>P</m> of trout <m>x</m> years from now.</li>
    <li>When will the Park Service have to restock the lake?</li>
    <li>Graph your equation for <m>P</m>, and illustrate your answer to part (b) on the graph.</li></ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li>The population starts this year at 430, and decreases by 60 for each following year. Thus, <m>P=430-60x</m>.</li>
    <li>We would like to find the value of <m>x</m> when <m>P=100</m>. We substitute 100 for <m>P</m>, and solve the equation for <m>x</m>.
        <me>\begin{aligned}
                100 \amp = 430-60x \amp \amp  \blert{\text{Subtract 430 from both sides.}}\\
                \blert{-430}  \amp = \blert{-430}\\
                -330 \amp = -60x   
                \end{aligned}</me>

        <me>\begin{aligned}
                \dfrac{-330}{\blert{-60}} \amp = \dfrac{-60x}{\blert{-60}} \amp \amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by}~-60.}\\
                5.5 \amp = x   
                \end{aligned}</me>

        The Park Service will have to restock the lake in five and a half years, if the population continues to decline at the current rate.</li>       
    <li>The figure shows the graph of the equation <m>P=430-60x</m>. To solve
            <me>100=430-60x</me>
         we locate the point on the graph with <m>P=100</m>, and read its <m>x</m>-coordinate, at about 5.5.

<subsection><title>Solving Inequalities</title>

<assemblage><p>A statement that uses one of the symbols <m>\gt</m> or <m>\lt</m> is called an <term>inequality</term>.</p></assemblage>

<p>Examples of inequalities are 
	<me> -1 \gt -3 ~~~~~~ \text{and}~~~~~~ x \lt 2</me> 	
Unlike the equations we have studied, which have at most one solution, an inequality can have infinitely many solutions.  A solution of an equation or inequality is said to <term>satisfy</term> the equation or inequality.</p>

<example><statement><p>Solve the inequality  <m>~x \lt 2</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>The solutions include <m>1, 0, -1, -2</m> and all the other negative integers, as well as fractions less than 2, such as <m>1\dfrac{3}{5},~ \dfrac{2}{3},</m> and <m>\dfrac{-17}{8}</m>.  All of these values satisfy the inequality <m>~x \lt 2</m>.</p>
<p> In fact, all the numbers to the left of 2 on the number line are solutions of <m>~x \lt 2</m>. Because we cannot list all these solutions, we often graph them on a number line as shown below.

The open circle at 2 shows that 2 itself is not a solution (because 2 is not less than 2.)</p></solution></example>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>An inequality that uses the symbol for less than, <m>\lt</m>, or greater than, <m>\gt</m>, is called a <term>strict inequality</term>. A nonstrict inequality uses one of the following symbols.
    <me>\begin{aligned}
        \amp \blert{\ge}  \amp \amp \text{means  "greater than or equal to"}\\
        \amp \blert{\le}    \amp \amp \text{means  "less than or equal to"}
    \end{aligned}</me>

For example, the graph of all solutions to the inequality
    <me>x \ge -2</me>
is shown below. We use a solid dot at <m>-2</m> to show that <m>-2</m> is included in the solutions.

<p>	The rules for solving inequalities are very similar to the rules for solving equations, with one important difference. In the Activities we will develop the following strategies for solving inequalities.</p>

<assemblage><title>To solve an inequality</title><p><ol label = "1">

<subsection><title>Compound Inequalities</title>
<p>An inequality in which the variable expression is bounded from above and from below is called a <term>compound inequality</term>  For example,
	<me>-3 \lt 2x-5 \le 6</me>
is a compound inequality. To solve a compound inequality, we must perform the steps needed to isolate <m>x</m> on all three sides of the inequality.</p>

<example><statement><p>Solve <m>~-3 \lt 2x-5 \le 6</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>To solve for <m>x</m>, we first add 5 on each side of the inequality symbols.
    <md alignment="alignat">
        <mrow>-3 \amp \lt 2x-5 \amp\amp\le 6</mrow>
        <mrow>\underline{\blert{+5}}\amp \quad\qquad\underline{\blert{+5}} \amp\amp ~~~~\underline{\blert{+5}}</mrow>
        <mrow>-2 \amp \le 2x \amp\amp \le 11 </mrow>
    </md>
Next, to solve <m>2 \lt 2x \le 11</m>, we divide each side by 2.
    <me>\begin{aligned}
                \dfrac{2}{\blert{2}} \amp \lt \dfrac{2x}{\blert{2}}  \le \dfrac{11}{\blert{2}}\\
                1 \amp \lt x  \le \dfrac{11}{2}  
                \end{aligned}</me>
The solution consists of all numbers greater than 1 but less than or equal to <m>\dfrac{11}{2}</m>. The graph of the solutions is shown below.
