<subsection><title>Intercepts of a Line</title>

<assemblage><p>The <term>intercepts</term> of a line are the points where the graph crosses the axes.</p></assemblage>

<p>It is easy to recognize the intercepts of a line on a good graph. Here is a graph of the line  
        <me>y=\dfrac{1}{2}x+4</me>
</p><sidebyside widths="50% 45%" valigns="middle middle" margins="0% 5%"><stack>  
<p>We can see that its <m>x</m>-intercept is the point <m>(-8,0)</m>, and its <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,4)</m>.</p> 
<p>If we have an equation for a line we can find the intercepts of its graph algebraically. In Example 1 we'll use algebra to find the intercepts of this line.</p></stack>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>Look at the intercepts on the graph above. Because the <m>y</m>-intercept of a graph lies on the <m>y</m>-axis, its <m>x</m>-coordinate must be zero. And because the <m>x</m>-intercept lies on the <m>x</m>-axis, its <m>y</m>-coordinate must be zero.</p></assemblage> 

<example><statement><p>Use algebra to find the intercepts of the graph of <m>~y=\dfrac{1}{2}x+4</m>.</p></statement>
<solution><p>To find the <m>y</m>-intercept, we substitute <m>\alert{0}</m> for <m>x</m> in the equation and solve for <m>y</m>.  
	<me>y=\dfrac{1}{2}(\alert{0})+4 = 4</me>  
The <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,4)</m>, as we saw above. To find the <m>x</m>-intercept, we substitute <m>\alert{0}</m> for <m>y</m> in the equation and solve for <m>x</m>.
	<me>\begin{aligned}
                \alert{0} \amp = \dfrac{1}{2}x+4 \amp \amp  \blert{\text{Subtract 4 from both sides.}}\\
                -4  \amp = \dfrac{1}{2}x  \amp \amp  \blert{\text{Multiply both sides by 2.}}\\
                -8  \amp = x   
                \end{aligned}</me>
The <m>x</m>-intercept is <m>(-8,0)</m>, as expected.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>The Intercept Method of Graphing</title>

<p>We can use the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-intercepts to graph a linear equation quickly. Instead of choosing several different values of <m>x</m> to find points on the graph, we find the two intercepts and fill in the short table shown below.  By finding the missing values for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> we are finding the intercepts of the graph.  
	<sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">              
                    <row bottom="minor">

                    </tabular></sidebyside></p>

<example><statement><p>Graph the equation <m>3x+2y=7</m> by the intercept method.</p></statement>

<solution><p>First, we find the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-intercepts of the graph. To find the <m>y</m>-intercept of the graph, we substitute <m>0</m> for <m>x</m> and solve for <m>y</m>.
	<me>\begin{aligned}
                3(\alert{0}) + 2y \amp = 7 \amp \amp  \blert{\text{Simplify the left side.}}\\
                2y  \amp = 7  \amp \amp  \blert{\text{Divide both sides by 2.}}\\
                y  \amp = \dfrac{7}{2} = 3\dfrac{1}{2}   
                \end{aligned}</me>
The <m>y</m>-intercept is the point <m>(0,3\dfrac{1}{2})</m>.</p>
<p>To find the <m>x</m>-intercept of the graph, we substitute <m>0</m> for <m>y</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.
	<me>\begin{aligned}
                3 + 2(\alert{0}) \amp = 7 \amp \amp  \blert{\text{Simplify the left side.}}\\
                3x  \amp = 7  \amp \amp  \blert{\text{Divide both sides by 3.}}\\
                x \amp = \dfrac{7}{3} = 2\dfrac{1}{3}   
                \end{aligned}</me>
The <m>x</m>-intercept is the point <m>(2\dfrac{1}{3}, 0)</m>.</p>
<p>Here is a table showing the two intercepts. We plot the intercepts and connect them with a straight line to obtain the graph below.
