  "body": " Elementary Algebra: Equations and Graphs was written with two goals in mind: to present the skills of algebra in the context of modeling and problem solving, and to engage students in an activity-based course.  Throughout the book, we use applications to motivate algebraic skills. We present ideas using verbal, numerical, and graphical tools. We use graphs extensively to illustrate algebraic techniques and to help students visualize relationships between variables. In the Homework Problems we break up skills practice into smaller sets of exercises and combine them with conceptual questions, graphing, and applications of various types.  We have included a number of features to encourage student participation.  The reading is broken into small segments by using boxes around Examples, definitions, and rules, and flags including Caution, Look Closer, and Look Ahead.  We want students to learn how to read a math book, so we have included Reading Questions that mirror the content of the lesson. For example, the first Reading Question is \"A numerical quantity that changes over time or in different situations is called a .\" Ideally, students would answer these questions before class, perhaps through an on-line homework system.  Each section ends with a Skills Warm-Up (with answers) for students to complete on their own. The Skills Warm-Up problems review an arithmetic or algebraic technique needed for the Lesson that follows.  Because choosing appropriate scales for the axes is a time-consuming task for beginning students, the text includes labeled grids for most of the graphing exercises. Ready-made grids allow students to consider a wider range of examples (with \"harder\" numbers) and to focus on the properties of the graphs, such as intercepts and slope, and on interpreting the information given by the graph. If students are using technology to create graphs, the grids can help them choose an appropriate window.  The textbook is accompanied by an Activities Workbook that provides a Lesson for each section in the book. These Lessons consist of Activities for students to complete in groups or with guidance from the instructor; or they can be used as support for a lecture format. Each Lesson ends with a Wrap-Up and a set of Homework Preview exercises.  Chapter Reviews include a Summary, Review Questions for writing or discussion, and a set of Review Problems. Answers to odd-numbered Homework problems are provided, as well as a Glossary of mathematical terms. A Review of Arithmetic Skills, with Exercises, appears in Appendix A.  The content of the text follows our \"guiding principles:\"  Develop the concepts and skills of algebra in context. Use applications to motivate and illustrate techniques. Don't frontload with \"theory\" or general principles.  Keep reading sections short and keep terminology to a minimum.  A solid understanding of basic algebra is more important than facility with complicated algorithms and procedures.  Include graphing from the beginning. The ability to read and analyze graphs is just as important as mastering algebraic skills. Emphasize the connection between equations and their graphs.  Present material by increasing levels of sophistication, not by taxonomy. In other words, don't have one chapter on simplifying expressions, and then a separate chapter on solving all kinds of equations, and so on. Instead, develop algebraic skills (writing expressions, solving equations, modeling) simultaneously and incrementally.  Review arithmetic skills \"just-in-time\" as needed (and often).  Some more advanced topics can be left for later courses, e.g. factoring sums of cubes.  Consequently, our text may differ in some ways from other treatments of the subject.  We begin with writing algebraic expressions instead of manipulating expressions. We use tables and graphs to motivate expressions.  Graphing appears in Chapter 1 and is continued throughout the book. Graphs are not restricted to grids.  We solve equations both algebraically and graphically.  Standard word problems are de-emphasized in favor of modeling.  Quadratic expressions and equations are treated before polynomials. We start with quadratic equations that can be solved by extracting roots.  We try to minimize factoring in the study of algebraic fractions.   An Instructor's Manual for the text is also available. The Manual contains objectives and teaching notes for each section of the text, as well as suggested concept questions and topics for writing or discussion. The teaching notes include suggestions for using the Activities booklet and how to structure class time.  Katherine Yoshiwara  Atascadero, CA 2019  "

  "body": "Variables  What is a Variable?  variable  Variable  variable  A variable is a numerical quantity that changes over time or in different situations.  We can show the values of a variable in a table or a graph.  Life expectancy is the average age to which people will live. The table below shows that your life expectancy depends on the year of your birth. Thus, life expectancy is a variable.    Year Born  Life Expectancy                                  To what age could people born in 1940 expect to live?  In what year did people's life expectancy reach 70 years of age?    People born in 1940 lived to 63 years of age on average.  Life expectancy reached 70 years of age in 1960.    The graph below shows the average annual salaries of NFL football players, starting in 1940. The average salary of NFL football players is a variable.    Use the graph to estimate the average annual salary of NFL football players in 1975.  By how much did salaries increase from 1975 to 1980?    In 1975, the average NFL player's salary was $40,000.  In 1980, the average salary was $80,000, so salaries had increased from $40,000 to $80,000, or by    A numerical quantity that changes over time or in different situations is called a . variable  We can show the values of a variable in a or a . table, graph  Look Closer  By displaying the values of a variable in a table or a graph, we sometimes see trends or patterns in those values. For example, we see that life expectancy has been increasing slowly over time, and that salaries of NFL football players have been increasing ever more rapidly since 1940.   Using Letters to Represent Variables  Imagine that you are traveling by airplane to another city. The table below shows the altitude of the airplane, in thousands of feet, at ten-minute intervals after take-off. The two quantities shown in the table, time and altitude, are both variables.    Time (min)               Altitude (1000 ft)               We often use a letter as a kind of short-hand to represent a variable. For this example, we use the following letters:   We can get a better feel for the variables by plotting them on a graph. In the figure below, the values of are displayed on the horizontal scale, or axis, and the values of are shown on the vertical axis. The graph shows how the values of are related to the values of .    airplane altitude    What is the value of when ? What do these values mean in this situation?  When is the plane descending?    The graph shows that is approximately 20 when . This means that at 85 minutes into the flight, the plane's altitude is about 20,000 feet.    airplane altitude   The plane is descending when its altitude is decreasing. On the graph, begins to decrease at and continues decreasing until . Thus, the plane is descending from the 70th minute until the end of the flight at 110 minutes.    We often use as a shorthand to represent variable quantities. letters  Which variable is displayed on the vertical axis in ? altitude  Look Ahead  It would be useful if we could discover a formula or rule to help us predict the values of an interesting variable.   Connections Between Variables  Sometimes there is a simple mathematical relationship between the values of two variables.  Fernando plans to share an apartment with three other students next year. The table shows his share of the rent for apartments of various prices.    Rent          Fernando's share           Fill in the blanks in the table. Describe in words how you found the unknown values.  Write a mathematical sentence mathematical sentence that gives Fernando's share of the total rent.  The total rent and Fernando's share are variables. Let stand for the total rent, and let stand for Fernando's share. Using these letters, write a formula for Fernando's share of the rent.  Plot the points from the table and connect them with a smooth curve. Extend your line so that it reaches across the entire grid, not just the points that you plotted.    Fernando's share of rent     mathematical sentence  A formula formula relating two variables is a type of equation equation , and an equation is just a statement that two quantities are equal.  By studying the values in a table, we may be able to find a relationship between the values, and then write an equation relating the two variables.  Write an equation that relates the two variables in the table.                  The two variables are and . Each column of the table shows a related pair of values. Notice that 2 is 3 less than 5, 7 is 3 less than 10, and so on. That is: and so on. In each column, we can find by subtracting 3 from . Thus, .   A statement that two quantities are equal is called an . equation  This is the end of the Reading portion of Section 1.1. Now try the Skills Warm-Up before the next class meeting.

Profit  profit formula for  To find the profit earned by a company we subtract the costs from the revenue.  The owner of a sandwich shop spent $800 last week for labor and supplies. She received $1150 in revenue. What was her profit?  We evaluate the formula with and to find The owner's profit was $350.  Interest  interest formula for  To find the interest earned on an investment we multiply the amount invested (the principal) by the interest rate and the length of the investment.  How much interest will be earned on $800 invested for 3 years in a savings account that pays % interest?  We evaluate the formula with , , and to find The account will earn $132 in interest.  Percent  percent formula for  To find a percentage or part of a given amount, we multiply the whole amount by the percentage rate.  How much ginger ale do you need to make 60 gallons of a fruit punch that is 20% ginger ale?  We evaluate the formula with and to find You would need 12 gallons of ginger ale.  Average  average formula for  To find the average of a collection of scores, we divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores.  Bert's quiz scores in chemistry are 15, 16, 18, 18, and 12. What is his average score?  We evaluate the formula with and to find Bert's average score is 15.8.   What does it mean to evaluate an expression?

Graph of an Equation  graph of an equation equation graph of  A graph has two axes axis , horizontal and vertical, and the values for the variables are displayed along the axes. The first, or input input variable , variable is displayed on the horizontal axis. horizontal axis -axis The second, or output output variable , variable is displayed on the vertical axis. vertical axis -axis  The graph itself shows how the two variables are related.  The graph below shows the relationship between Delbert's age, , and Francine's age, . Write an equation for Francine's age in terms of Delbert's age.    Relationship between Delbert's and Francine's ages   In this graph, is the input variable and is the output variable. We make a table of values by reading points on the graph.                  From the table, we see that the value of is always 4 more than the value of . Thus, Francine is exactly four years older than Delbert, or .   A is a way of visualizing an algebraic equation. graph  The values of the variables are displayed on the . axes  The input variable is located on the axis. horizontal  Each point on a graph has two coordinates, which designate the position of the point. For example, the point labeled in has horizontal coordinate 3 and vertical coordinate 7.  Ordered pair  ordered pair  In the Example above, we write the coordinates of point inside parentheses as an ordered pair : . The order of the coordinates makes a difference. We always list the horizontal coordinate first, then the vertical coordinate.   The position of a point on the graph is given by its . coordinates  The notation is called . an ordered pair  In an ordered pair, we always list the coordinate first. horizontal  Look Closer  How does the graph illustrate the equation ? The coordinates of each point on the graph are values for and that make the equation true. The coordinates of the point , namely and , represent the fact that when Delbert was 3 years old, Francine was 7 years old. If we substitute these values into our equation we get which is true.  Solution of an equation  solution to an equation in two variables  An ordered pair that makes an equation true is called a solution of the equation. Each point on the graph represents a solution of the equation.   Locate on the graph each of the ordered pairs listed in the table of above, and make a dot there. Label each point with its coordinates.  By substituting its coordinates into the equation, verify that each point you labeled in part (a) represents a solution of the equation .    An ordered pair whose coordinates make the equation true is called a of the equation. solution    Graphing an Equation  graph of an equation equation graph of  The simplest way to draw a graph for an equation is to make a table of values and plot the points.  Graph the equation .  In this equation, is the input variable and is the output variable. We choose several values for and use the equation to find the corresponding values for .     Calculation                          points on line  Each ordered pair represents a point on the graph of the equation. We plot the points on the grid and connect them with a smooth curve, as shown above.   Choosing Scales for the Axes  axis choosing scale for  If the variables in an equation have very large (or very small) values, we must choose scales for the axes that fit these values.  To graph an equation  graph of an equation equation graph of   Make a table of values.  Choose scales for the axes.  Plot the points and connect them with a smooth curve.  Graph the equation .  To graph this equation, we choose multiples of 50 for the -values.     Calculation                          graph of line  The largest -value in the table is 450, so we scale the axis to a little larger than 450, say, 500. We plot the ordered pairs to obtain the graph shown above.  Look Closer  How do we know what scales to use on the axes? For most graphs, it is best to have between ten and twenty tick marks on each axis, or the graph will be hard to read. We choose intervals of convenient size for the particular problem, such as 5, 10, 25, 100, or 1000. It is not necessary to use the same scale on both axes.  It is important that the scales on the axes be evenly spaced. Each tick mark must represent the same interval. The scales on the graph below are incorrectly labeled.   inappropriately labeled grid   Solving Equations with Graphs  equation solving with graphs  In the first Example we showed a graph of the equation which gives Francine's age, , in terms of Delbert's age, . We can use the graph to answer two types of questions about the equation :  Given a value of , find the corresponding value of .  Given a value of , find the corresponding value of .

Use the graph of the equation to evaluate the expression for . Verify your answer algebraically.  Use the graph of the equation to solve the equation . Verify your answer algebraically.    We locate on the horizontal axis, as shown at left below. Then we move vertically to point on the graph with -coordinate 7. Finally, we move horizontally from point to the vertical axis to find the -coordinate. The coordinates of point are , which tells us that when . Our answer is 11.  To verify the answer algebraically, we evaluate the expression for : we substitute for into the equation:   We locate on the vertical axis. We move horizontally to point on the graph shown above right, with -coordinate 13. From point , we move vertically to the horizontal axis to find the -coordinate. The coordinates of point are , which tells us that when . Our answer is 9.  To verify the answer algebraically, we solve the equation when : we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:  Here is a graph of Use the graph to solve the equation .  y=1.5x  By comparing the equation of the graph with the equation we want to solve, we see that has been replaced by . We locate 3.75 on the -axis, then find the point on the graph with -coordinate 3.75.  y=1.5x The -coordinate of this point is 2.5, so the ordered pair is a solution of the equation , and is the solution of the equation .

Write an equation that relates the distance, , that Corey can travel to the number of gallons of gas, , in his truck.  Graph the equation.  Step 1: Make a table of values. Choose values of between 0 and 20, because Corey's truck holds 20 gallons of gas. Use the equation to calculate the values of .                   Step 2: Choose scales for the axes: Use 10 grid lines on the horizontal axis. The length of each interval is so we scale the horizontal axis in intervals of 2. On the vertical axis, we use increments of 25 from 0 to 400, which gives us 16 grid lines.  Step 3: Plot the points from the table of values. You will need to estimate the location of some of the points between tick marks.    grid     The Harris Aircraft company gave all its employees a 5% raise.

  "body": "Solving Equations  equation solution of  What is an Equation?  Equation  equation  An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal. It may involve one or more variables.  Liz makes $6 an hour as a tutor in the Math Lab. Her weekly earnings, , depend on the number of hours she works, . The equation relating these two variables is If we know the value of , we can evaluate the expression to find Liz's earnings. For example, if , then Liz makes $42 for 7 hours of work.  In the previous Example we used evaluation to find the value of when we knew the value of . What if we know the value of and want to find ? Suppose Liz earned $54 last week. How many hours did she work? To answer this question we substitute for , so that the equation becomes Now we have an equation in just one variable. We would like to find the value of that makes this equation true.  Solution of Equation  equation solution of solution of equation  solving an equation solving an equation equation  A value of the variable that makes an equation true is called a solution of the equation, and the process of finding this value is called solving the equation.   Trial and Error  trial and error  Some equations are easy enough to solve by trial and error. You can probably see that the solution of the equation is 9. We can use a table to help us solve a harder equation by trial and error.  One of Aunt Esther's Chocolate Dream cookies contains 42 calories, so cookies contain calories, and . If Albert consumed 546 calories, how many cookies did he eat? Use trial and error to help you solve the equation .                             Look Ahead  Trial and error can be time-consuming, especially for complicated equations! In this section we investigate some algebraic methods for solving equations.   What is an equation? An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal.  What is a solution of an equation? A value of the variable that makes an equation true.   Inverse Operations  inverse operations  Instead of relying on trial and error to solve equations, we will use inverse operations . Try the Exercise below.   Did you end up with your original number? Try multiplying and dividing your number by another number besides 5. Do you still end up with your original number?  Inverse Operations  inverse operations  Multiplication and division are opposite or inverse operations , because each operation undoes the effects of the other.   Did you end up with your original number? Try adding and subtracting another number besides 4. Do you still end up with your original number?  More Inverse Operations  inverse operations  Addition and subtraction are opposite or inverse operations , because each operation undoes the effects of the other.  We see that the opposite operation for multiplication is division, and the opposite operation for addition is subtraction. Now we can solve the equation in .  Solve the equation .  We will transform this equation into a new one of the form (or ), where the number is the solution.  To do this, we must isolate the variable on one side of the equals sign. Because is multiplied by 6 in this equation, we divide both sides by 6, like this: The solution is 9. Liz worked for 9 hours.  Look Closer  Note that the expression says \"multiply by 6, then divide the result by 6,\" so we end up with again.  In the previous Example, we transformed the equation into a simpler one (namely, ) which tells us the solution. We can use the following operations to transform an equation:  To solve an equation algebraically  equation solving algebraically   We can add or subtract the same number from both sides.  We can multiply or divide both sides by the same number, as long as that number is not zero.  Look Closer  Our method for solving equations works because of the properties of equality , one for each of the four arithmetic operations. They are listed below.  Addition and Subtraction Properties of Equality  properties of equality addition and subtraction  If the same quantity is added to or subtracted from both sides of an equation, the solution is unchanged. In symbols,  Multiplication and Division Properties of Equality  properties of equality multiplication and division  If both sides of an equation are multiplied or divided by the same nonzero quantity, the solution is unchanged. In symbols,  Applying any one of these properties to an equation produces an equivalent equation : one with the same solutions as the original equation.   Solving Equations  equation solving  Now we can solve equations algebraically. We'll start with the simple Example from Section 1.3 about Delbert's and Francine's ages.  Francine is exactly four years older than Delbert, so an equation relating their ages is . How old is Delbert when Francine is 19?  We must solve the equation We see that 4 has been added to the variable, . To isolate on one side of the equals sign, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation, like this: The solution to this equation is 15. You can check that substituting for does make the equation true.   Look Ahead  That last example is easy enough to solve without algebra, but the method will help us with harder problems. Here is a general strategy for solving such equations.  To solve an equation algebraically  equation solving algebraically   Ask yourself what operation has been performed on the variable.  Perform the opposite operation on both sides of the equation in order to isolate the variable.    What is the opposite operation for subtraction? For multiplication? Addition, division  What are equivalent equations? Equations with the same solutions.   Problem Solving with Equations  equation problem solving with  Some problems can be solved by applying one of our familiar formulas.  A saving's account at Al's Bank earns 5% annual interest. Jan's account earned $42.50 in interest last year. What was her balance at the beginning of the year?  First, we choose the appropriate formula. This is a problem about interest, so we use the interest formula: Next, we list the values of the variables. (Which variable is unknown?) We substitute the values into the formula: Then we solve the equation: Finally, we answer the question in a sentence:  Many practical problems can be solved by first writing an equation that describes or models the problem, and then solving the equation. We will use three steps to solve applied problems.  Steps for solving an applied problem  applied problems   Identify the unknown quantity and choose a variable to represent it.  Find some quantity that can be described in two different ways, and write an equation using the variable to model the problem situation.  Solve the equation and answer the question in the problem.   Jerry needs an additional $35 for airfare to New York. The ticket to New York costs $293. How much money does Jerry have?  We follow the three steps.  The amount of money Jerry has is unknown.  The airfare to New York can be described in two different ways:   We solve the equation and answer the question.  Jerry has $258.  In Example 5, each side of the equation represents the airfare to New York, not the amount of money Jerry has, which is what we want to find. This is typical of applied problems: the equation does not usually represent the unknown quantity itself, but some related quantity.  Look Ahead  Although you may be able to solve the problems in this lesson with arithmetic, the important thing is to learn to write the algebraic equation, or model, for the problem. This skill will help you to solve problems that are too difficult to solve with arithmetic alone.   What is the first step in solving an applied problem? Identify the unknown quantity and choose a variable to represent it.  True or false: One side of the equation that models a problem will be the unknown variable. False  This is the end of the Reading portion of Section 1.4. Now try the Skills Warm-Up before the next class meeting.

A sum of three or more terms can be added in any order. In the sums below, the parentheses tell us which part of the expression to simplify first.  Similarly, a product of three factors can be multiplied in any order. Thus   These two facts illustrate the associative laws for addition and multiplication.

Subtraction:  Division:   subtraction not commutative division not commutative  The associative laws do not hold for subtraction or division.  So, if there are no parentheses in the expression, how do we know which operations to perform first?  order of operations   In a string of additions and subtractions, we perform the operations in order from left to right.  Similarly, we perform multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.   Simplify each expression.    Perform the operations in order from left to right.     What do the associative laws tell us? A sum of three or more terms, or a product of three or more factors, can be calculated in any order.  Which two operations are not associative?

If we do the addition first, we get If we do the multiplication first, we get  Which one is correct? In order to avoid confusion, we make the following agreement.  order of operations  Always perform multiplications and divisions before additions and subtractions.  The correct way to simplify the expression is  Look Closer  In longer expressions, it can be helpful to group the expression into its terms before beginning. Terms are expressions separated by addition or subtraction symbols. We simplify each term before combining them.  Simplify  We start by underlining each term of the expression separately. Then we simplify each term.   In , we do not start by adding . We must perform multiplications before additions.  We simplify by performing the operations from left to right:   Parentheses  What if the addition should come first in a particular calculation? In that case, we use parentheses to enclose the sum, like this:  order of operations parentheses  Perform any operations inside parentheses first.  Simplify.     Is it true that multiplications should be performed before divisions? Why or why not? Perform multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.  What do parentheses tell us? Perform any operations inside parentheses first.  If there are no parentheses, in what order should we perform multiplications and divisions? In order from left to right.   Fraction Bars  Like parentheses, a fraction bar is a grouping device .  order of operations fraction bars Expressions that appear above or below a fraction bar should be simplified first.  Simplify  We begin by computing the sums above and below the fraction bar. Then we can reduce the fraction. Thus,  Do not be tempted to \"cancel\" the terms in . For example, it would be incorrect to write According to the order of operations, we must simplify the numerator and denominator first, before dividing.   Besides parentheses, what other symbol serves as a grouping device? Fraction bar  When adding fractions, which should you do first: reduce each fraction, or find an LCD? Find an LCD   Summary  Combining all our guidelines for simplifying expressions, we state the rules for the order of operations.  Order of Operations  order of operations summary   First, perform any operations that appear inside parentheses, or above or below a fraction bar.  Next, perform all multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.  Finally, perform all additions and subtractions in order from left to right.    Algebraic Expressions  The order of operations applies to variables as well as constants. For example, the expression tells us to multiply by 2, then add 5 to the result. Thus, to evaluate the expression for for example, we write  In the Example below, note how parentheses change the meaning of an expression.  Write algebraic expressions for each of the following phrases. Then evaluate each phrase for and .

In the Reading assignment, we established the following rules.   In a string of additions and subtractions, we perform the operations in order from left to right  Similarly, we perform multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.  Simplify each expression.    Combined operations  Always perform multiplications and divisions before additions and subtractions.  Simplify each expression.    Grouping into terms  Simplify    Activity 2: Parentheses and Fraction Bars   Parentheses: Simplify each expression.    Fraction Bars: Simplify  Perform operations inside parentheses.  Simplify above the fraction bar — multiplication first.  Simplify below the fraction bar — multiplication first.  Reduce the fraction.  If an expression involves more than one type of grouping symbol (say, both parentheses and brackets), we start with the innermost grouping symbols and work outward.  Follow the steps to simplify   Subtract inside parentheses.  Multiply inside the brackets.  Subtract inside the brackets.  Multiply, then add.

Consider the expression , which simplifies to or . If we enter the expression into a calculator as we get 0, which is not correct. This is because the calculator follows the order of operations and calculates first.  If we use a calculator to compute , we must tell the calculator that should be computed first. To do this, we use parentheses and enter the expression as We call this way of writing the expression the in-line form .  When using a calculator, we must enclose in parentheses any expression that appears above or below a fraction bar.  Use a scientific calculator to simplify the expression .     Wrap-Up  Objectives  In this Lesson we practiced the following skills:  Simplifying expressions by following the order of operations  Using a calculator to simplify expressions  Questions   Give examples to show that the associative laws do not hold for subtraction or division.

  "body": " Chapter 1 Summary and Review  Lesson 1.1 Variables  A variable is a numerical quantity that changes over time or in different situations.  We can use a table, a graph, or an equation to compare the values of two related variables.  A formula relating two variables is a type of equation , and an equation is just a statement that two quantities are equal.   Lesson 1.2 Algebraic Expressions  An algebraic expression is any meaningful combination of numbers, variables, and operation symbols.  Commutative Laws  Addition: If and are numbers, then  Multiplication: If and are numbers, then  Subtraction and division are not commutative; the order of the numbers matters in a difference or a quotient.  To write an algebraic expression  Identify the unknown quantity and write a short phrase to describe it.  Choose a variable to represent the unknown quantity.  Use mathematical symbols to represent the relationship.  The process of substituting a specific value for the variable into an expression is called evaluating the expression.  An equation is a mathematical statement that two algebraic expressions are equal. A formula is an equation that relates two or more variables.  Some Useful Algebraic Formulas  distance rate time  profit revenue cost  interest principal interest rate time  part percentage rate whole  average score     Lesson 1.3 Equations and Graphs  A graph is a way of visualizing an algebraic equation in two variables. The first or input variable is displayed on the horizontal axis and the second or output variable is displayed on the vertical axis.  Each point on a graph has two coordinates , which designate the position of the point.  An ordered pair of numbers that make an equation true is called a solution of the equation. Each point on the graph of an equation represents a solution of the equation.  If the variables in an equation have very large (or very small) values, we must choose scales for the axes that fit these values.  To graph an equation  Make a table of values.  Choose scales for the axes.  Plot the points and connect them with a smooth curve.  We can use a graph to evaluate an algebraic expression or to solve an equation.   Lesson 1.4 Solving Equations  To solve an equation algebraically, we use inverse , or opposite, operations.  To solve an equation algebraically  Ask yourself what operation has been performed on the variable.  Perform the opposite operation on both sides of the equation in order to isolate the variable.   Operations for solving an equation  We can add or subtract the same number from both sides.  We can multiply or divide both sides by the same number, as long as that number is not zero.  Properties of Equality  If the same quantity is added to or subtracted from both sides of an equation, the solution is unchanged. In symbols,  If both sides of an equation are multiplied or divided by the same nonzero quantity, the solution is unchanged. In symbols,  Many practical problems can be solved by first writing an equation that describes or models the problem, and then solving the equation.  Steps for solving an applied problem:  Identify the unknown quantity and choose a variable to represent it.  Find some quantity that can be described in two different ways, and write an equation using the variable to model the problem situation.  Solve the equation and answer the question in the problem.   Lesson 1.5 Order of Operations  Associative Laws  Addition: If and are any numbers, then  Multiplication: If and are any numbers, then  The associative laws do not hold for subtraction or division.  Order of Operations  First, perform any operations that appear inside parentheses, or above or below a fraction bar.  Next, perform all multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.  Finally, perform all additions and subtractions in order from left to right.  When using a calculator, you must enclose in parentheses any expression that appears above or below a fraction bar.  Review Questions  Use complete sentences to answer the questions.  What is a variable? Give an example.  What is the difference between an algebraic expression and an equation?   Write as an algebraic expression \" subtracted from .\"  Evaluate your expression for and .   Write as an algebraic expression \" divided by .\"  Evaluate your expression for and .  State a formula from this chapter for each of the variables below.  Distance:  Profit:  Interest:  Percentage or part:  Average value:  State formulas for the perimeter and area of a rectangle, and for the area and circumference of a circle.  When we construct the graph of an equation, which variable is displayed on which axis?  Write a paragraph explaining how the following terms are related to an equation in two variables: solution, coordinates, ordered pair.  State the order of operations for simplifying algebraic expressions.  Review Problems   Martha can travel 22 miles on a gallon of gasoline.

Integers integer  The natural numbers, zero, and the negatives of the natural numbers are called the integers :  Fractions, such as and , lie between the integers on the number line.   What are integers? The natural numbers, zero, and the negatives of the natural numbers.   As we move from left to right on a number line, the numbers increase.

Express the relationship using one of the order symbols.   Negative altitudes correspond to feet below sea level, and 94 feet is farther below sea level than 81 feet. Therefore, feet is the lower altitude.  , or   Adding Two Numbers with the Same Sign  number line adding numbers with the same sign  We'll use number lines to review operations on signed numbers.  Case 1: The sum of two positive numbers  Illustrate the sum on a number line.  Graph the first number, , as shown below.  Move units in the positive direction, or to the right.  This brings us to the sum, which is . Thus, .   number line  Case 2: The sum of two negative numbers  Illustrate the sum on a number line.  Graph the first number, , as shown below.  Move units in the negative direction, or to the left.  This brings us to the sum, , as expected. Thus, .   number line  Look Closer  In the examples above, we see that: Thus, the sign of the sum is the same as the sign of the two terms. To find the value of the sum, we add the absolute values absolute value , or unsigned parts, of the two terms.  Add  The sum is negative. We add the absolute values of and (the numbers 4 and 7 without their signs) to get 11, then make the sum negative:   Adding Two Numbers with Opposite Signs number line adding numbers with the opposite signs  Suppose you have debts of $9, and assets of $6. (Your \"assets\" are your possessions.) What is your net worth? We can model this situation by the sum where debts are represented by negative numbers and assets by positive numbers. If you use your $6 to pay off part of your debt, you will still owe $3, so your net worth is . It makes sense that if your debts are greater than your assets, your net worth is negative.  The sum of two numbers with opposite signs  Illustrate the sum on a number line.  Graph the first number, , as shown below.  Move units in the positive direction, or to the right.  This brings us to the sum, . Thus, .   number line  Look Closer  In the example above, we see that the sum has the same sign as the number with the larger absolute value. (Can you explain this in terms of debts and assets?) When the two numbers have opposite signs, we find the value of the sum by subtracting the absolute values of the two numbers.   Add  Add   The two numbers have opposite signs, so we subtract 5 from 9 to get 4, then make the answer positive, because has a larger absolute value than . Thus,  We subtract 5 from 9 to get 4, then make the answer negative, because has a larger absolute value than . Thus,   What is the absolute value absolute value of a number?

Rules for Adding Integers  addition of signed numbers  addition rules for adding integers  integer rules for adding  addition of integers  signed number addition of   To add two numbers with the same sign, add their absolute values. The sum has the same sign as the numbers.  To add two numbers with opposite signs, subtract their absolute values. The sum has the same sign as the number with the larger absolute value.

The picture is identical to the graph above.  number line    Look Closer  We see that subtracting a positive number has the same result as adding the negative number with the same absolute value. Thus, to subtract a positive number, we add its opposite.   Subtracting a Negative Number  number line subtracting a negative number  When we add a negative number we move to the left on the number line. There are only two directions we can move on a number line, so when we subtract a negative number we must move to the right.  Subtracting a negative number  Compare the graphs for adding and subtracting  Addition: Move 3 units to the left, to get 2.  number line  Subtraction: Move 3 units to the right, to get 8.  number line  Look Closer  Notice that Subtracting a negative number has the same result as adding the positive number with the same absolute value. Thus, to subtract a negative number, we add its opposite.   True or False: always represents a negative number. Give an example to support your answer. False. If , then .  Subtracting a negative number is the same as with the same absolute value. adding a positive number   From the examples above, we see that to subtract any number, positive or negative, we add its opposite. We can do this in steps as follows.  Rules for Subtracting Integers  subtraction of signed numbers  subtraction rules for adding integers  integer rules for subtracting  subtraction of integers  signed number subtraction of  To subtract from :  Change the sign of .  Change the subtraction to addition.  Proceed as in addition.  This rule tells us that we can rewrite every subtraction problem as an addition problem by changing the sign of the second number.  Rewrite each subtraction problem as an addition, then compute the answer.   subtracting positive from positive   subtracting positive from negative   subtracing negative from positive   subtracting negative from negative  Look Closer  At first it may be difficult to understand why subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number. Try thinking in terms of debts and assets. For example, suppose you have $25 in your wallet, and you have $5 in your hand to pay off a debt you owe a friend. If your friend now cancels (or subtracts) the debt, you are actually $5 richer:  For simple subtractions we don't really need the subtraction rule. For example, we can subtract just as we did in arithmetic: However, if the subtraction involves negative numbers, it is usually easier to use the subtraction rule. Thus,  Look Ahead  We can interpret the expression either as a subtraction or as an addition: Both give the same result, . Because addition is easier than subtraction, it is better to think of a long expression such as as a sum of signed numbers. To do this, we add all the numbers together, and the or sign in front of each number tells us whether that number is positive or negative.  Remember that additions should be performed in order from left to right.  Simplify  We add the signed numbers and and and , in order from left to right.   The following calculation is incorrect: We must perform additions and subtractions in order from left to right:   Multiplying Signed Numbers  signed number multiplying  multiplication of signed numbers  product of signed numbers  Case 1: The product of numbers with opposite signs  We can think of multiplication as repeated addition. For example, Similarly, which is , so . Think in terms of money: if you owe three different people 2 dollars each, then you are 6 dollars in debt.  Because multiplication is commutative, it is also true that . This example illustrates the following fact.  Products  The product of a positive number and a negative number is a negative number.  You can use your calculator to verify the following products.     Case 2: The product of numbers with the same sign  You know that the product of two positive numbers is positive. It is also true that the product of two negative numbers is positive.  To understand why the product of two negative numbers is positive, you might think of canceling, or subtracting, several debts of the same amount. Or, you could observe the pattern in the lists of products below. As we move down the list, the product increases by equal amounts. Based on the pattern in these calculations, the following rule seems reasonable.  More Products  The product of two negative numbers is a positive number.  You can use your calculator to verify the following products.    Now we have a pair of rules about the products of signed numbers.  Products of Signed Numbers  signed number multiplying  multiplication of signed numbers  product of signed numbers   The product of two numbers with opposite signs is a negative number.  The product of two numbers with the same sign is a positive number.    Dividing Signed Numbers  signed number division of  division of signed numbers  quotient of signed numbers  Division is the inverse operation for multiplication. For example, we know that Thus, every division fact can be converted into an equivalent multiplication fact. For example, Note that the numerator in the division fact becomes the product in the multiplication fact. The same relationship between multiplication and division holds for negative numbers as well.  Rewrite each division fact as a multiplication fact.    The numerator in each division fact becomes the product in the multiplication fact.    The Example above illustrates the rules for division of signed numbers.  Quotients of Signed Numbers  signed number division of  division of signed numbers  quotient of signed numbers   The quotient of two numbers with opposite signs is a negative number.  The quotient of two numbers with the same sign is a positive number.   Which of these is a product?     c  Rewrite the division fact as a multiplication fact.   Remember that a fraction can be thought of as a division. For example, means , or 0.75. What about negative fractions?  Because the quotient of two numbers with unlike signs is negative, the fractions and both represent the negative number .  On the other hand, is equal to the positive number .  For many of the calculations in algebra, it is more convenient to write a negative fraction with the minus sign in the numerator, like this: .  Standard Form for Fractions  standard form of writing negative fractions fractions standard form for writing negative fraction  A negative fraction is written in standard form when the minus sign is in the numerator: . The standard form for a positive fraction has positive numerator and denominator.   Quotients Involving Zero  quotient involving zero  division involving zero  What is the meaning of an expression such as ? We can rewrite this quotient as an equivalent multiplication fact. What number can we substitute for the question mark to make a true statement? The only solution for this equation is . Thus, replacing the question marks by we have In general, 0 divided by any (non-zero) number is 0.  Now consider a quotient with zero in the denominator, such as . What number can we substitute for the question mark to make a true statement? This equation has no solution, because 0 times any number is 0, not 2. Thus, there is no answer for the division problem . We say that the quotient is undefined undefined quotient . In general, we cannot divide any number by zero. undefined division by zero  Quotients Involving Zero  quotient involving zero  division involving zero  undefined quotient  undefined division by zero If is any nonzero number, then   is undefined.

Writing down the expression for a specific numerical value can help us write an algebraic expression.  Alida keeps $100 in cash from her weekly paycheck, and deposits 40% of the remainder in her savings account. If Alida's paycheck is , write an expression for the amount she deposits in savings.  How would we calculate Alida's deposit if we knew her paycheck? Suppose Alida's paycheck is $500. First she subtracts $100 from that amount to get , and then she takes 40% of the remainder for savings: If her paycheck is dollars, we perform the same operations on instead of on 500. The expression is thus   We write an expression with variables using the same operations we would use to calculate with a . specific number  In , how does Alida calculate the amount to deposit in savings? How do we write that in an algebraic expression? Subtract 100 from her paycheck, then multiply the result by 0.40.    Evaluating Algebraic Expressions  algebraic expression evaluating  When we evaluate an algebraic expression, we must follow the order of operations.  Four students bought concert tickets with their $20 student-discount coupons.  If the regular price of a ticket is dollars, write an expression for the total amount the four students paid.  How much did the students pay if the regular price of a ticket is $38?   The discount price of one ticket is dollars. So four tickets cost  We evaluate the expression in part (a) for . The students paid $72 for the tickets.   Explain why we need parentheses in . We need to subtract before we multiply.  How should we write \"3 times the sum of and 12\"?    Negative Numbers  The order of operations applies to signed numbers. Operations inside parentheses or other grouping devices should be performed first.  Simplify  Perform the operations inside brackets first. Simplify each step by rewriting subtractions as equivalent additions.   Which operation is performed first in the expression ? multiplication  What is the first step in evaluating the expression ? Subtract from 18   When using negative numbers, we must be careful to distinguish between products and sums. In , note how the parentheses and minus signs are used in each expression.  Simplify each expression.       This expression is a product:  This is a subtraction. We follow the rule for subtraction by changing the sign of the second number and then adding:  This is an addition; the negative sign in front of tells us that we are adding to . Thus,  This is also an addition:   What is wrong with this calculation: ? We should subtract first.   Look Closer  When we evaluate an algebraic expression at a negative number, we enclose the negative numbers in parentheses. This will help prevent us from confusing multiplication with subtraction.  Evaluate for and .  We substitute for and for , then follow the order of operations.   When we evaluate an expression at a negative number, we should the negative number in . enclose; parentheses    Skills Warm-Up   Choose the correct algebraic equation for each of the following situations.

  "body": "Graphs of Linear Equations  Graphing Equations  linear equation graph of  graph of an equation equation graph of  Linear Equation  linear equation  An equation of the form , where and are constants, is called a linear equation because its graph is a straight line.  We can graph a linear equation by evaluating the expression at several values of and then plotting points.  At 6 am the temperature was , and it has been rising by every hour.  Write an equation for the temperature, , after hours.  Graph your equation.   We set at 6 am. At that time, . Because the temperature is rising by every hour, we multiply the number of hours by 4 and add the result to 50 to get the new temperature. Thus, our equation is .  Step 1: We make a table of values for the equation. We choose some values for , as shown in the first column of the table below. For each value of , we evaluate the formula for , and we record these values in the second column of the table.              Ordered pairs                               Step 2: We use the values in the table to help us choose scales for the axes. For this graph, the input values are less than 10, but the largest output value is 70. We use increments of 1 on the horizontal or -axis and increments of 10 on the vertical or -axis.  Step 3: Each ordered pair gives us a point on the graph. We plot the points on the grid and connect them with a smooth curve. All the points should lie on a straight line.  graph of line    A linear equation has the form .  We use to help us choose scales for the axes. the values in the table    Cartesian Coordinate System  Cartesian coordinate system  Many graphs include negative values as well as positive values. To make such a graph, we construct a Cartesian coordinate system Cartesian coordinate system , named after the French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes.  We draw two perpendicular number lines for the horizontal and vertical axes. The two axes divide the plane into four quadrants quadrant , or regions, as shown at right. We often use for the input variable input variable and for the output variable output variable , so the horizontal axis axis horizontal is called the -axis x -axis and the vertical axis axis vertical is the -axis y -axis . The axes intersect at the zero point of each number line. The coordinates of this intersection point, called the origin origin , are .   grud: 5 by 5   What are the coordinates of the origin?  True or False: The -coordinate of any point on the -axis is zero. True   The figure at right shows how to plot points on a Cartesian grid. Points in the upper right quadrant have both coordinates positive. Points with negative -coordinates are plotted to the left of the -axis, and points with negative -coordinates are plotted below the -axis.  For example, the point is plotted 2 units to the left of the -axis and 1 unit above the -axis. In which quadrant are both coordinates negative?   points on grid    True or False: The notation represents two points, one on the -axis and one on the -axis. False  True or False: If both coordinates of a point are negative, the point is located in the lower left quadrant. True   Now we can graph an equation that includes negative values.  The temperature in Nome was F at noon. It has been rising at a rate of F per hour all day.  Write an equation for the temperature, , after hours.  Fill in the table and graph your equation. (Negative values of represent hours before noon.)                      Use your graph to answer the following questions:  What was the temperature 8 hours before noon?  When will the temperature reach F?   The temperature at hours after noon is given by .  We evaluate the expression for at each of the -values in the table.                       graph of line   We find the point on the graph with -coordinate . Its -coordinate is , so the temperature was F.  We find the point on the graph with -coordinate . Its -coordinate is 4, so it will be F at 4 pm.  Look Closer  We can also answer parts (c) and (d) of using algebra.  For part (c), we evaluate the expression for , namely , at .  For part (d), we solve the equation with . Make sure that you understand both methods, graphical and algebraic.  Graphing Tip #1  If the coefficient of (the number multiplying ) is a fraction, we can make our work easier by choosing multiples of the denominator for the -values. That way we won't have to work with fractions to find the -values. In the Example below, the coefficient of is , so we choose multiples of 3 for the -values.   Graph  Use the graph to solve the equation    We choose -values that are multiples of 3 and make a table of values.                            Then we plot the points and connect them with a straight line.   graph of line   We see that has been replaced by in the equation of the graph. So we look for the point on the graph that has -coordinate . This point, labeled on the graph below, has -coordinate .   point on graph of line  Because it lies on the graph, the point is a solution of the equation . When we substitute and into the equation, we get a true statement: But this statement also tells us that is a solution of the equation .   What is the first step in graphing an equation? Make a table of values  Which -values would you choose to graph ? Multiples of 4   Graphing Tip #2  When you graph a linear equation, you should extend the line far enough in both directions so that it will cross both the -axis and the -axis. The points where the graph crosses the axes are important for applications.  Look Closer  The graph of an equation is a picture of the solutions of the equation. Each point on the graph represents a solution. If a point lies on the graph, its coordinates make the equation true.

  "body": "Linear Equations and Inequalities  Solving Equations solving an equation equation solving  We solve an equation by isolating the variable on one side of the equation. If an equation involves two or more operations, we must undo those operations in reverse order.  The equation describes college tuition consisting of a $50 registration fee plus $15 per unit. How many units can you take if you have $290 saved for tuition?  We can answer the question by solving the equation where we have substituted $290 for the tuition, . Think about the expression . How would you evaluate this expression if you were given a value for ? Following the order of operations, you would In order to solve the equation, we must reverse these two steps to undo the operations and isolate the variable. We first subtract 50 from both sides of the equation: This isolates the term that contains the variable, . Then we divide both sides of the equation by 15. You can enroll in 16 units. We can check the solution by substituting 16 for in the original equation. Because a true statement results, the solution checks.  Look Closer  In , notice how we reversed the operations used in the equation.  Strategy for solving equations  To solve an equation that involves two or more operations, we undo those operations in reverse order.  Solve  The left side of the equation has two terms: and . We want to isolate the term containing the variable, so we subtract 8 from both sides. Next, we divide both sides by to get The solutions is 6.  In the second step of , the term means \" times ,\" so we divide both sides by . Do not try to add 3 to both sides.   If an equation involves more than one operation, how must we undo those operations? In reverse order  Delbert says he solved the equation by adding to both sides. What is wrong with his method? He should divide by .    Applied Problems  applied problems  Problem solving often involves signed numbers, either in the equation that models the problem or in its solution, or both.  The trout population in Clear Lake is decreasing by approximately 60 fish per year, and this year there are about 430 trout in the lake. If the population drops to 100, the Park Service will have to restock the lake.  Write an equation for the population of trout years from now.  When will the Park Service have to restock the lake?  Graph your equation for , and illustrate your answer to part (b) on the graph.   The population starts this year at 430, and decreases by 60 for each following year. Thus, .  We would like to find the value of when . We substitute 100 for , and solve the equation for . The Park Service will have to restock the lake in five and a half years, if the population continues to decline at the current rate.  The figure shows the graph of the equation . To solve we locate the point on the graph with , and read its -coordinate, at about 5.5.  graph   Solving Inequalities  solving an inequality inequality solving  Inequality inequality  A statement that uses one of the symbols or is called an inequality .  Examples of inequalities are Unlike the equations we have studied, which have at most one solution, an inequality can have infinitely many solutions. A solution of an equation or inequality is said to satisfy satisfy an equation or inequality the equation or inequality.  Solve the inequality  The solutions include and all the other negative integers, as well as fractions less than 2, such as and . All of these values satisfy the inequality .  In fact, all the numbers to the left of 2 on the number line are solutions of . Because we cannot list all these solutions, we often graph them on a number line as shown below.  number line The open circle at 2 shows that 2 itself is not a solution (because 2 is not less than 2.)  Look Closer order symbol  An inequality that uses the symbol for less than, , or greater than, , is called a strict inequality . A nonstrict inequality uses one of the following symbols. For example, the graph of all solutions to the inequality is shown below. We use a solid dot at to show that is included in the solutions.  number line    A solution of an inequality is said to the inequality. satisfy  What is the difference between a strict and a nonstrict inequality? A nonstrict inequality includes \"equal to.\"   The rules for solving inequalities are very similar to the rules for solving equations, with one important difference. In the Activities we will develop the following strategies for solving inequalities.  To solve an inequality  inequality solving solving an inequality   We can add or subtract the same quantity on both sides.  We can multiply or divide both sides by the same positive number.  If we multiply or divide both sides by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality.  Solve and graph the solutions on a number line.  We isolate on one side of the inequality. The graph of the solutions is shown below.  number line    Compound Inequalities  inequality compouind compound inequality  An inequality in which the variable expression is bounded from above and from below is called a compound inequality For example, is a compound inequality. To solve a compound inequality, we must perform the steps needed to isolate on all three sides of the inequality.  Solve  To solve for , we first add 5 on each side of the inequality symbols. Next, to solve , we divide each side by 2. The solution consists of all numbers greater than 1 but less than or equal to . The graph of the solutions is shown below.  number line    When do we need to reverse the direction of an inequality? When we multiply or divide by a negative number.  What is a compound inequality? One in which the variable expression is bounded from above and from below.    Skills Warm-Up   Solve each equation. Try to do so mentally (without using pencil and paper.)         Fill in the tables.

  "body": "Like Terms  Equivalent Expressions  equivalent expressions expression equivalent  When we solve an equation such as we find a value for the variable that makes the equation true. The solution to this equation is 5, because the two expressions and 17 are equal if . If we use any other value for , say or , then does not equal 17.  It is possible for two algebraic expressions to be equal for all values of the variable. For instance, the expressions and will always give the same value when the same number is substituted for in each expression. For example, Both expressions equal 15 when .   Verify that and are equal when .   Equivalent Expressions  equivalent expressions expression equivalent  Two algebraic expressions are equivalent equivalent if they name the same number for all values of the variable.  Thus, and are equivalent expressions, and we can replace one by the other if it will simplify our work.  Although two expressions may name the same number for some values of the variable, they are not necessarily equivalent. For example, to show that the expressions and are not equivalent, we only have to find a single value of for which they are not equal. If we evaluate each expression for , we find: Because they are not equal for , the expressions and are not equivalent.   When are two expressions equivalent? When they name the same number for all values of the variable.    Like Terms  term like like terms  We saw above that and are equivalent expressions. This makes sense when we consider what these expressions mean: means two 's added together, and means three 's added together. Then We can add two 's to three 's and get five 's, just as we can add two pencils to three pencils, or two dollars to three dollars. In algebra this is called combining like terms combining like terms combining like terms like terms .  Like Terms  like terms  Like terms are any terms that are exactly alike in their variable factors.   because their variable factors are identical.  because their variable factors are different.  Numerical Coefficient  numerical coefficient numerical coefficient coefficient coefficient  The numerical factor factor in a term is called the numerical coefficient , or just the coefficient of the term.   In the expression , the number 3 is the numerical coefficient.  In a term such as or , the numerical coefficient is 1.  If a variable is preceded by a negative sign, the coefficient of the term is . For example,    Adding and Subtracting Like Terms  like terms adding and subtracting  like terms combining  To add like terms  like terms adding and subtracting  Add the numerical coefficients of the terms. Do not change the variable factors of the terms.  Add like terms.     In each calculation, we do not change the variables we are adding; only the coefficient changes.      Look Ahead  In , we replaced each expression by a simpler but equivalent expression. In other words, is equivalent to , and is equivalent to .  Simplifying an expression  expression simplifying  simplifying an expression  Replacing an expression by a simpler equivalent one is called simplifying the expression.  We subtract like terms in the same way that we add like terms.  To subtract like terms  like terms adding and subtracting  like terms combining  Subtract the numerical coefficients of the terms. Do not change the variable factors of the terms.    What are like terms? Any terms that are exactly alike in their variable factors.  How do we add or subtract like terms? Add or subtract the numerical coefficients of the terms.   We cannot add or subtract unlike terms. Thus,   Many expressions contain both like and unlike terms. In such expressions we can combine only the like terms.  Simplify  We combine all the -terms, and all the constant terms, like this: so  In , because and are not like terms.   Removing Parentheses parentheses removing  When we add signed numbers, we can remove parentheses that follow an addition symbol. For instance, We can also remove parentheses when we add like terms. Thus,  Removing parentheses that follow a plus sign parentheses removing  Parentheses preceded by a plus sign may be omitted, and each term within parentheses keeps its original sign.  Simplify  Each set of parentheses is preceded by a plus sign, so we may remove the parentheses.   We must be careful when removing parentheses preceded by a minus sign. In the expression the minus sign preceding applies to each term inside the parentheses. Therefore, when we remove the parentheses we must change the sign of from to and we must change the sign of from to . Thus,  Removing parentheses that follow a minus sign parentheses removing  If an expression inside parentheses is preceded by a minus sign, we change the sign of each term within parentheses and then omit the parentheses and the minus sign.  Simplify  Before combining like terms, we must remove the parentheses. We change the signs of any terms inside parentheses preceded by a minus sign; we do not change the signs of terms inside parentheses preceded by a plus sign.  equations   We can remove parentheses that follow . a plus sign  What must you do if you remove parentheses that follow a minus sign? Change the sign of each term within parentheses.    Solving Equations and Inequalities  equation solving inequality solving  We can now solve equations in which two or more terms contain the variable.  Solve the equation  We first get all terms containing the variable on one side of the equation. For this example, we will subtract from both sides of the equation to get Now the equation looks like ones we already know how to solve, and we proceed as usual to isolate the variable. The solution is 5.   If one side of an equation or inequality contains like terms, we should combine them before beginning to solve.  Solve  We combine like terms on each side of the inequality, to get Now we continue solving as usual: We want to get all the terms containing on one side of the inequality, and all the constant terms on the other side. The solution is all -values greater than 3. You can check the solution by substituting one -value greater than 3 and one value less than 3 into the original inequality, for instance:   What should you do if one side of an equation or inequality contains like terms? Combine them.   Here are our guidelines for solving linear equations.  Steps for Solving Linear Equations  equation solving   Combine like terms on each side of the equation.  By adding or subtracting the same quantity on both sides of the equation, get all the variable terms on one side and all the constant terms on the other.  Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable to obtain an equation of the form .   Skills Warm-Up   Write algebraic expressions.

  "body": " Chapter 2 Summary and Review  Lesson 2.1 Signed Numbers  The natural numbers, zero, and the negatives of the natural numbers are called the integers .  We use special symbols to indicate order:  The absolute value of a number is the unsigned part of the number. It is never negative.  Rules for Adding Integers  To add two numbers with the same sign, add their absolute values. The sum has the same sign as the numbers.  To add two numbers with opposite signs, subtract their absolute values. The sum has the same sign as the number with the larger absolute value.  Rules for Subtracting Integers  To subtract from :  Change the sign of .  Change the subtraction to addition.  Proceed as in addition.  Products and Quotients of Signed Numbers  The product or quotient of two numbers with opposite signs is a negative number.  The product or quotient of two numbers with the same sign is a positive number.  Quotients Involving Zero  If is any nonzero number, then   Section 2.2 Expressions and Equations  When we evaluate an algebraic expression, we follow the order of operations.  When we evaluate an algebraic expression at a negative number, we enclose the negative numbers in parentheses.  Section 2.3 Graphs of Linear Equations  An equation of the form , where and are constants, is called a linear equation because its graph is a straight line.  We can graph a linear equation by evaluating the expression at several values of and then plotting points.  We use a Cartesian coordinate system to make a graph that includes negative values of the variables.  The graph of an equation is a picture of the solutions of the equation. Each point on the graph represents a solution.  Section 2.4 Linear Equations and Inequalities  To solve an equation that involves two or more operations, we undo those operations in reverse order.  A statement that uses one of the symbols or is called an inequality .  Rules for Solving Inequalities  We can add or subtract the same quantity on both sides.  We can multiply or divide both sides by the same positive number.  If we multiply or divide both sides by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality.  Each point on the graph of an equation represents a solution of the equation. To solve the equation for a particular -value, we locate the corresponding point on the graph.  To solve a compound inequality , we perform the steps needed to isolate on all three sides of the inequality.  Section 2.5 Like Terms  Two algebraic expressions are equivalent if they name the same number for all values of the variable.  Like terms are any terms that are exactly alike in their variable factors. By adding or subtracting like terms we can replace one algebraic expression by a shorter or simpler one.  The numerical factor in a term is called the numerical coefficient , or just the coefficient of the term.  Replacing an expression by a simpler equivalent one is called simplifying the expression.  To add or subtract like terms  Add or subtract the numerical coefficients of the terms. Do not change the variable factors of the terms.  Removing parentheses  Parentheses following a plus sign may be omitted; each term within parentheses keeps its original sign.  To remove parentheses that follow a minus sign, we change the sign of each term within parentheses and then omit the parentheses and the minus sign.  Steps for Solving Linear Equations  Combine like terms on each side of the equation.  By adding or subtracting the same quantity on both sides of the equation, get all the variable terms on one side and all the constant terms on the other.  Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable to obtain an equation of the form .   Review Questions  Use complete sentences to answer the questions.  Explain the terms natural numbers, whole numbers, and integers.  A classmate claims that the opposite of a number and the absolute value of a number are the same, and uses as an example. Do you agree? Give examples of your own.

  "body": "Ratio and Proportion  Ratios ratio  A ratio ratio is a type of quotient used to compare two numerical quantities.  For example, suppose the ratio of pupils to computers at a local elementary school is 10 to 3. This means that for every 10 pupils in the school there are 3 computers. We often display a ratio as a fraction, like this:  This ratio does not mean that there are exactly 10 pupils and 3 computers at the school. There could be 40 pupils and 12 computers or 200 pupils and 60 computers (or many other combinations) because  In a survey of 100 of his classmates, Greg found that 68 students supported a strict gun control law, while 32 students did not. What is the ratio of survey respondents who support gun control to those opposed?  The ratio of those supporting gun control to those opposed is 68 to 32, or . This ratio reduces to , or 17 to 8.  When we write a ratio, it is important to notice which number is the numerator, and which number is the denominator. When we write \"the ratio of to \" as a fraction, is the numerator and is the denominator.  In , we could also compute the ratio of opponents to supporters of the gun control law. In that case, the answer would be or , the reciprocal of the answer to Example 1.  Ratio ratio  A ratio is a type of quotient used to compare two numerical quantities. The ratio of to is written .  Look Closer  A ratio can be expressed as a decimal instead of a common fraction. Because is equal to 2.125, we can write the ratio in as 2.125 to 1. We usually express a ratio as a decimal fraction if the numbers being compared are decimal numbers.  A small circuit board measures 4.2 centimeters long by 2.4 centimeters wide. What is the ratio of its length to its width?  The ratio of length to width is , or 1.75, as you can verify with your calculator. (Can you express this ratio as a common fraction?)   What is a ratio? A type of quotient comparing two quantities  When do we express a ratio as a decimal fraction? When the numbers being compared are decimal numbers    Rates  Rate rate  A rate rate is a ratio that compares two quantities with different units.  You are already familiar with many rates. If you say that your average speed was 50 miles per hour, or that apples cost 89 cents per pound, you are using rates. Because per usually indicates division,  Sarah traveled 390 miles on 15 gallons of gas. Express her rate of fuel consumption as a ratio, and then as a rate.  As a ratio, Sarah's rate of fuel consumption was .  We simplify by dividing the denominator into the numerator, to get , or 26 miles per gallon.   Proportions proportion  Proportion  proportion  A proportion proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal.  Thus, a proportion is an equation in which both sides are ratios. Here are some proportions: A proportion may involve variables. How can we solve a proportion such as this one? Because is divided by 6, we could multiply both sides of the equation by 6 to clear the fraction. But we can clear both fractions at the same time if we multiply by the LCD (Lowest Common Denominator) of the two fractions. In this case, the LCD is . Multiplying both sides by 30 gives us Now we can divide both sides by 5 to get the answer,  Look Ahead  There is a short-cut we can use that avoids calculating an LCD. We can obtain the equation by cross-multiplying:  cross-multiplying Then we complete the solution as before.  Property of Proportions  proportion property of proportion cross-multiply cross-multiply proportion  We can clear the fractions from a proportion by cross-multiplying.  Solve  We apply the property of proportions and cross-multiply to get We can check the solution by substituting into the original proportion.  Cross-mutiplying works only for solving proportions! Do not try to use cross-multiplying on other types of equations, or for other operations on fractions. In particular, do not use cross-multiplying when multiplying fractions or adding fractions.   What is a rate? A ratio that compares quantities with different units  What is a proportion? A statement that two ratios are equal  What is the short-cut for solving a proportion called? Cross-multiplying    Proportional Variables  proportional variables  Suppose that grape juice costs 80 cents per quart, and complete the table.    Number of Quarts  Total Price (cents)                    Did you find that the ratio , or price per quart, is the same for each row of the table? This agrees with common sense: The price per quart of grape juice is the same no matter how many quarts you buy.  Proportional Variables  proportional variables  Two variables are proportional proportional variables if their ratio is always the same.  One quart of grape juice costs 80 cents. The price of grape juice is proportional to the number of quarts you buy. How much grape juice can you buy for $10.00?  Let represent the number of quarts you can buy for $10.00, or 1000 cents. Because the variables total price and number of quarts are proportional, we know that their ratio is constant. Thus, the ratio We solve the proportion by cross-multiplying to get You can buy 12.5 quarts of grape juice for $10.00. (Or, if you can only buy quart bottles, then you can buy 12 quarts and have 40 cents left over.)  When writing a proportion, we must be careful that both ratios have the same units in their numerators, and the same units in their denominators. In the example above, it would not be correct to equate and , because the ratios do not have the same units.  For the grape juice example, the ratio was always equal to 80. The number 80 is called the constant of proportionality .  Look Closer  If we let stand for the price of the grape juice and stand for the number of quarts purchased, we have the equation The graph of this equation is a straight line that passes through the origin, as shown below.   graph of line   Equation for Proportional Variables  proportional variables equation for proportional variables constant of proportionality  If two variables are proportional, they are related by the equation where is the constant of proportionality constant of proportionality .

In order to fire a particular kind of pottery, the pieces must first be cured by raising the temperature slowly and evenly. Sonia checks the temperature in the drying oven at ten-minute intervals, and records the following data.    Time,  0  10  20  30  40  50  60   Temperature,  70  74  78  82  86  90  94   The heat in the oven should not increase any faster than 0.5 degree per minute. Is the temperature in the oven within the safe limits?  A graph of the data is shown at right.  Sonia calculates the rate at which the temperature is rising by finding the following ratio:    oven temperature vs time  For example, over the first 10 minutes, the temperature rises from 70 degrees to 74 degrees, so or 0.4 degree per minute. This is less than the maximum rate recommended for curing the pottery.  You can check that over each ten-minute interval the temperature again rises by four degrees, so it appears that the oven is heating up at an acceptable rate.   What is a rate of change? A type of ratio that measures how one variable changes with respect to another  What are the units of the rate of change in ? degrees per minute    Slope  We introduce some new notation to use when calculating a rate of change.  The Greek letter Delta ( ) change in Delta Delta (\"delta\") is used in mathematics to indicate change.  In , we used the variable to represent time and to represent the temperature, so we denote the ratio by . With this notation, we calculate the rate of change of temperature between the data points and as follows:  We can illustrate the rate of change on a graph of the data, as shown below. We move from the point to the point by moving horizontally a distance of and then vertically a distance of .   graph with slope  The rate of change of one variable with respect to another is so important in applications that the ratio is given a name; it is called slope , and is usually denoted by the letter m as slope .  Slope  slope slope formula for  The slope of a line is defined by the ratio as we move from one point to another on the line. In symbols,  Look Closer  The slope of a line measures how fast the -coordinate changes as we increase the -coordinate of points on the line. More specifically, when we move one unit in the -direction, how many units should we move in the -direction to get back to the line?  Use the points and to compute the slope of the line shown.   lgraph of line with slope  The point has coordinates , and has coordinates . As we move along the line from to , the -coordinate changes by 3 units, and the -coordinate changes by 4 units. The slope of the line is thus The slope tells us that if we start at any point on the line and move 1 unit in the -direction, we must move unit in the -direction to return to the line.  Note the difference between the statements and ; they are not the same! When we discuss a graph,  means that the -coordinate of a particular point is 3, but  means that the -coordinate changes by 3 units when we move from one point to another.   What does mean in mathematics? Change in .  How do we indicate on a graph? By a horizontal arrow  What is the name of the ratio , and what letter is used to represent it? slope,    Meaning of Slope slope meaning  In , we graphed the temperature of a pottery oven over time. We calculated the slope of the graph as The slope gives us the rate of change of the temperature with respect to time: the temperature is increasing at a rate of 0.4 degrees per minute.   slope meaning  The slope of a line measures the rate of change of with respect to .  In different situations, this rate might be interpreted as a rate of growth or a speed. The slope of a graph can give us valuable information about the variables involved.  The graph shows the distance traveled by a driver for a cross-country trucking firm in terms of the number of hours she has been on the road.  graph   Compute the slope of the graph.  What is the meaning of the slope for this problem?   Choose any two points on the line, say and shown in the figure. As we move from to we find The slope of the line is 50.  The best way to understand the slope is to include units in the calculation. or The slope represents the trucker's average speed or velocity.  In , we refer to a point by a capital letter and the coordinates of the point, like this: . This means that and at the point . Do not confuse the coordinates of a particular point with the values of and obtained by moving from one point to a second point.   What does the slope of a line measure? the rate of change of with respect to  What does the slope of the line measure in ? the trucker's average speed or velocity    Geometrical Meaning of Slope  slope meaning  Suppose we graph two lines with positive slope on the same coordinate system. If we move along the lines from left to right, then the line with the larger slope will be steeper. This makes sense if we think of the slope as a rate of change: The line whose -coordinate is increasing faster with respect to is the steeper line.  Look Closer  You can verify the slope given for each line in figure (a) by computing . For each unit you increase in the -direction, the steepest line increases 2 units in the -direction, the middle line increases 1 unit in the -direction, and the flattest line increases only unit.   positive slopes  negative slopes  Figure (b) shows several lines with negative slopes. These lines slant downwards or decrease as we move from left to right. The more negative the slope, the more sharply the line decreases. For both increasing and decreasing graphs, the larger the absolute value of the slope, the steeper the graph.  Slopes measure the relative steepness of two lines only if they are graphed on axes with the same scales. Changing the scale on either the -axis or the -axis can greatly alter the appearance of a graph.   What sort of lines have negative slopes? Lines that slant downwards or decrease as we move from left to right    Skills Warm-Up   Write a rate for each of the following situations, including units.

Slope-Intercept Method of Graphing  slope-intercept form method for graphing  slope-intercept form method for graphing slope-intercept method slope-intercept method  A linear equation has the form , and its graph is a straight line. We have already studied two methods for graphing linear equations:  Make a table of values and plot points  Find and plot the intercepts (the intercept method)  There is a third graphing method that makes use of the slope of the line. We can use the slope-intercept form to sketch a graph quickly, without having to plot a lot of points.  Graph the equation  The slope of the line is and its -intercept is the point . We begin by plotting the -intercept, as shown in the figure. Next, we use the slope to find another point on the line.  graph of line The slope, gives the ratio of the change in -coordinate to the change in -coordinate as we move from any point on the line to another. Thus, starting at the point , we move:  3 units up (the positive -direction),then  4 units right (the positive -direction ) to locate another point on the line. The coordinates of this new point are . Finally,we draw a line through the two points, as shown in the figure.  Look Closer  To improve the accuracy of the graph in , we can find a third point on the line by writing the slope in an equivalent form. We change the sign of both numerator and denominator of the slope to get Starting again from the -intercept , we now move 3 units down and 4 units left, and find the point on the graph.   Name two methods of graphing that we have already studied. Plotting points and the intercept method  When using the slope-intercept method, what is the first point we plot? the -intercept  How do we use the slope to find a second point on the line? From the -intercept, move units in the -direction and units in the -direction   The slope-intercept method can be used to graph any non-vertical line.  To Graph a Line Using the Slope-Intercept Method  slope-intercept method   Write the equation in the form .  Plot the -intercept, .  Write the slope as a fraction, .  Use the slope to find a second point on the graph: Starting at the -intercept, move units in the -direction, then units in the -direction.  Find a third point by moving units in the -direction, then units in the -direction, starting from the -intercept.  Draw a line through the three plotted points.   Finding the Slope-Intercept Form  slope-intercept form finding  Not all linear equations appear in slope-intercept form. However, we can write the equation of any non-vertical line in slope-intercept form by solving the equation for in terms of .  Find the slope and -intercept of the graph of  To write the equation in slope-intercept form, we solve for in terms of . The equation is now in slope-intercept form, with and . Thus, the slope of the graph is and the -intercept is the point .  Do not confuse solving for with finding the -intercept. In the Example above, we do not set before solving for .  When we find the -intercept, we are looking for a specific point, namely, the point with -coordinate zero, so we replace by 0.  When we \"solve for ,\" we are writing the equation in another form, so both variables, and , still appear in the equation.   How do we put an equation into slope-intercept form?

Let's summarize the results of the Activity. In part 1 we graphed three equations: All of these equations have the same , namely 30, but different -intercepts. In each case the -intercept is the same as the term in the equation. (This makes sense, because we find the intercept by setting .)  In part 2 we graphed All of these equations pass through the origin, so their -intercepts are all , but each has a different . In each case, the slope is the same as the coefficient of in the equation. This also makes sense if you think about it: if we increase by one hour, then increases by 60 miles, increases by 30 miles, and increases by 100 miles.

It is easy to understand that parallel lines have the same slope.    Calculate the slopes of the two parallel lines in the figure.

It is a little harder to see the relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines.    Calculate the slopes of the two perpendicular lines in the figure.   perpendicular lines   In the Reading Question above, note that the product of and is , that is, This relationship holds for any pair of perpendicular lines.  Parallel and Perpendicular Lines  lines parallel lines parallel   Two lines are parallel if their slopes are equal, that is, if or if both lines are vertical.  Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is , that is, if or if one of the lines is horizontal and one is vertical.   What do we call two lines that lie in the same plane but never intersect? Parallel lines  What are perpendicular lines? Lines that intersect at right angles   Decide whether the lines are parallel, perpendicular, or neither.  We could graph the lines, but we can't be sure from a graph if the lines are exactly parallel or exactly perpendicular. A more accurate way to answer the question is to find the slope of each line. To do this we write each equation in slope-intercept form, that is, we solve for .     The slope of the first line is , and the slope of the second line is . The slopes are not equal, so the lines are not parallel. However, the product of the slopes is so the lines are perpendicular.  Look Closer  perpendicular lines lines perpendicular negative reciprocal  Another way to state the condition for perpendicular lines is Because of this relationship, we often say that the slope of one perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal of the other.   What is true about the slopes of parallel lines? They are equal.  What do we call the slopes of perpendicular lines? Negative reciprocals    Equations for Horizontal and Vertical Lines  lines horizontal horizontal line lines vertical vertical line  In Lesson we learned that the slope of a horizontal line is zero. slope of horizontal line What does this tell us about the equation of a horizontal line that passes through a particular point?

Looking at the graph of the line shown below, we see that the -coordinate of every point on the line is 3.  horizontal line  In particular, the -intercept of the line is the point , so .

Look Closer  undefined slope of vertical line  slope vertical line  What about the equation of a vertical line? The slope of a vertical line is undefined; a vertical line does not have a slope. We cannot use the slope-intercept form to write the equation of a vertical line. However, we can use what we learned about horizontal lines in .   Look at the graph of the vertical line at right. Every point on the line has -coordinate , no matter what the -coordinate is. An equation for this line is .

The slope of every horizontal line is zero, but the equation of a horizontal line has the form , where is the -coordinate of every point on the line.  Similarly, the equation of a vertical line has the form , but the slope of a vertical line is undefined.   Give an example of an equation of a vertical line.  Give an example of an equation of a horizontal line.    Distance Between Points  distance between points  It is easy to compute the distance between two points that lie on the same horizontal or vertical line. We subtract the smaller coordinate from the larger one.  The distance between the points and in the figure is and the distance between points and is   a vertical segment and a horizontal segment  Note that the distance between two points is always a positive number. That is why we always subtract the smaller coordinate from the larger one to compute distance. However, when we compute a slope, we need more information.  Look Closer  When we compute slope, the direction in which we move on the line makes a difference. We will call this the directed distance directed distance distance directed , and it can be either positive or negative.  If we move from to , we have moved in the positive -direction, so the directed distance is positive: If we move from to , we have moved in the negative -direction, so the directed distance is negative:  Directed Distance  directed distance distance directed  To find the directed distance between two points on a number line, we subtract the initial coordinate from the final coordinate.   How do we find the distance between two points that lie on the same vertical line? Subtract the smaller -coordinate from the larger one  A directed distance can be either or . positive, negative   Look Ahead  So far we have computed the slope of a line by finding and on the graph. Now we can use directed distance to develop a formula for slope.  Compute the slope of the line segment joining and in two ways:  Find and using the graph  Find and using coordinates.   graph   As we move from to , we move up 2 squares on the graph, so . As we move from to , we move 8 squares to the right, so . Thus, the slope of the line is  First we write down the coordinates of and : and compute the directed distance from to : Then we write down the coordinates of and : and compute the directed distance from to : We get the same value for the slope as in part (a),   Subscript Notation  subscript notation  When we compute the slope of a line joining two points, we must be careful to subtract their -coordinates and their -coordinates in the same order, final minus initial. To distinguish between the coordinates of different points, we use a new notation called subscripts subscript .  Subscripts  subscript notation subscript  We denote the coordinates of a particular point by and the coordinates of a second point by .  Compute the slope between point and in the figure.  graph  We'll call the first point and the second point. Then their coordinates are Now we can describe the formula for slope in an organized way. We compute and as directed distances. First, we observe that the coordinates of point are or . From the figure, we can see that and Thus, the slope of the line segment joining and is  The subscript 1 on , for instance, has nothing to do with the value of the coordinate; it merely identifies this coordinate as the -coordinate of the first point.   What do the subscripts in mean? Coordinates of the first point  Write a formula for computing .    A New Formula for Slope  The method described in gives us a new formula for computing slope.  Two-Point Formula for Slope  slope formula for  two-point formula for slope  The slope of the line joining points and is  We don't need a graph in order to use this formula, just the coordinates of two points on the line.  Compute the slope of the line joining the points and .  It doesn't matter which point is and which is , so we choose to be . Then and . Thus,  In , we can reverse the order of both subtractions to find the same answer as before. The order of the points does not matter, but we must be consistent and use the same order when computing and .   What is wrong with this formula for slope: ? The - and -coordinates should be subtracted in the same order.    Skills Warm-Up   For Problems 1-8, find the negative reciprocal.           For Problems 9-14, simplify.

  "body": " Chapter 3 Summary and Review  Lesson 3.1 Intercepts  The intercepts of a line are the points where the graph crosses the axes.  The intercepts of a graph often represent the starting or ending values for a particular variable.  To find the intercepts of a graph  To find the -intercept of a graph:  Substitute for in the equation and solve for .  To find the -intercept of a graph:  Substitute for in the equation and solve for .  To Graph a Linear Equation Using the Intercept Method  Find the - and -intercepts of the graph.  Draw the line through the two intercepts.  Find a third point on the graph as a check. (Choose any convenient value for and solve for .)    Lesson 3.2 Ratio and Proportion  A ratio is a type of quotient that allows us to compare two numerical quantities.  Ratio  The ratio of to is written .  A rate is a ratio that compares two quantities with different units.  A proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal. In other words, a proportion is a type of equation in which both sides are ratios.  We use cross-multiplying to solve proportions.  Property of Proportions   Two variables are said to be proportional if their ratios are always the same.  Lesson 3.3 Slope  The slope of a line measures the rate of change of with respect to .  Slope  The slope of a line is defined by the ratio as we move from one point to another on the line. In symbols,  Lines have constant slope. No matter what two points on a line we use to calculate its slope, we always get the same result.  The slope of a horizontal line is zero, and the slope of a vertical line is undefined.  Lesson 3.4 Slope-Intercept Form  Slope-Intercept Form  A linear equation written in the form is said to be in slope-intercept form . The coefficient is the slope of the graph, and is the -intercept.  The constant term in the slope-intercept form tells us the initial value of , and the coefficient of tells us the rate of change of with respect to .  To Graph a Line Using the Slope-Intercept Method   Write the equation in the form .  Plot the -intercept, .  Write the slope as a fraction, .  Use the slope to find a second point on the graph: Starting at the -intercept, move units in the -direction, then units in the -direction.  Find a third point by moving units in the -direction, then units in the -direction, starting from the -intercept.  Draw a line through the three plotted points.  Lesson 3.5 Properties of Lines  Parallel and Perpendicular Lines   Two lines are parallel if their slopes are equal, that is, if or if both lines are vertical.  Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is , that is, if or if one of the lines is horizontal and one is vertical.  Horizontal and Vertical Lines   The equation of the horizontal line passing through is  The equation of the vertical line passing through is  Two-Point Formula for Slope  The slope of the line joining points and is  Review Questions  Use complete sentences to answer the questions.  Explain how to find the intercepts of a graph.  What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?  State the fundamental property of proportions.  How can we tell if two variables are proportional?  Give a formula for slope using the notation.  State the slope-intercept formula, and explain the meaning of the coefficients.  Explain the slope-intercept method for graphing a line.  What is the easiest way to find the slope of a line from its equation?  How can we tell if two lines are perpendicular?

  "body": "The Distributive Law distributive law  Products product of algebraic expressions  So far we have considered sums and differences of algebraic expressions. Now we take a look at simple products. To simplify a product such as , we multiply the numerical factors to find This calculation is an application of the associative law for multiplication. We can see why the product is reasonable by recalling that multiplication is repeated addition, so that      Explain the difference between the expressions and . The first expression is a sum and the second one is a product.    The Distributive Law distributive law  Another useful property for simplifying expressions is the distributive law. First consider a numerical example. Suppose we would like to find the area of the two rooms shown at right. We can do this in two different ways:   rectangle   Method 1: Think of the rooms as one large rectangle, with width 10 feet and length feet. The area is then given by  Method 2: Find the area of each room separately and add the two areas together. This gives us  Of course, we get the same answer with either method. However, looking at the first step in each calculation, we see that We see that there are two ways to compute the expression .  The first way follows the order of operations, adding first.  The second way distributes the multiplication to each term inside parentheses; that is, we multiply each term inside the parentheses by 10.  This last equation is an example of the distributive law.  Distributive Law  distributive law  If and are any numbers, then  Look Ahead  If the terms inside parentheses are not like terms, we have no choice but to use the distributive law to simplify the expression.  Simplify  We multiply each term inside parentheses by :  Compare the three similar expressions: To simplify these expressions, we must first recognize the operations involved.  The first is a sum of terms.  The second is a product.  The third is an application of the distributive law.   When do we need the distributive law to simplify an expression? If the terms inside parentheses are not like terms    Solving Equations and Inequalities  equation solving inequality solving  If an equation or inequality contains parentheses, we use the distributive law to simplify each side before we begin to solve.  Solve  We apply the distributive law to the right side of the equation. You should verify each step of the solution, and check the answer.  The expression on the right side of the equation in is made up of two terms: Remember that we think of all terms as added together, so the minus sign in front of the 2 tells us that 2 is negative. When we apply the distributive law, we multiply each term inside parentheses by to get .  We know that a fraction bar often serves as a grouping device, like parentheses.  Solve the proportion  We apply the property of proportions and cross-multiply to get We can check the solution by substituting into the original proportion.   In , why did we put parentheses around and ? To replace the fraction bars as grouping symbols    Algebraic Expressions  algebraic expression simplifying  We can often simplify algebraic expressions by combining like terms.  Delbert and Francine are collecting aluminum cans to recycle. They will be paid dollars for every pound of cans they collect. At the end of three weeks, Delbert collected 23 pounds of aluminum cans, and Francine collected 47 pounds.  Write algebraic expressions for the amount of money Delbert made, and the amount Francine made.  Write and simplify an expression for the total amount of money Delbert and Francine made from aluminum cans.    We multiply the number of pounds collected by the price per pound.

  "body": "Systems of Linear Equations system of linear equations  system of linear equations system of equations  What is a System of Equations?  In many applications it is useful to write two or more linear equations.  Delbert and Francine are buying appliances for their new home. They have a choice of two different refrigerators: a standard model that sells for $1000, or an energy-efficient model at a price of $1200. The standard model costs $6 per month to run, and the energy-efficient model costs $2 per month. Write linear equations for the total cost of each refrigerator after months.  Let stand for the total cost of running the standard refrigerator for months, so . The initial cost of the standard model is $1000, so . The cost increases at a rate of $6 per month, so . Thus, Let stand for the total cost of running the energy-efficient refrigerator. For this model, the initial cost is , and the total cost increases at a rate of dollars per month. Thus,  Look Closer  When we consider two equations together, as in the example above, we often use the same variables for both equations, like this:   System  system of linear equations  A pair of linear equations with the same variables is called a system of linear equations .   In , the standard refrigerator costs less initially, but costs more to run each month. Delbert and Francine want to know when the energy-efficient model will begin to pay for itself, or in other words, when the total cost of running the standard model will exceed the total cost of the energy-efficient model.  When is the total cost of running the two refrigerators in equal?  We would like to know the value of when . We could use trial-and-error by evaluating both and for various values of . The results of such a search are given in the table below.                         We see that when , the total cost of both models is $1300. Thus, at the end of 50 months, or 4 years 2 months, the cost of the standard model equals the cost of the energy-efficient model.  In we found an ordered pair, ,that makes both equations true.  Solution to a System  system of linear equations solution  solution to a system of equations  A solution to a system of equations is an ordered pair that satisfies each equation in the system.  To check whether is really a solution of the system, we substitute the coordinates into each equation. We have verified that the ordered pair is a solution to the system in .   What is a solution to a system of equations? An ordered pair that satisfies each equation in the system.  Decide whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system No    Solving a System of Equations by Graphing  system of equations solve by graphing  The solution of a system satisfies both equations in the system, so the point that represents the solution must lie on both graphs. It is the intersection point of the two lines described by the system. Thus, we can solve a system of equations by graphing the equations and looking for the point (or points) where the graphs intersect.  Solve the system in by graphing.  The graph of the two equations is shown below. The graph of has a smaller initial value than , but it increases more rapidly because its slope is greater. The two graphs intersect at the point labeled .   graph of two lines  At this point the values of and are the same, approximately 1300. The -coordinate of point is 50, so the solution of the system is . The total cost of each model is about $1300 over the first 50 months of operation.  After 50 months, the total cost of the energy-efficient model will be less than the cost of the standard model.   How do we find the solution to a system of equations by graphing? Locate the intersection point of the two graphs.    Inconsistent and Dependent Systems  system of equations inconsistent  inconsistent system of equations  system of equations dependent  dependent system of equations  Delbert and Francine are also shopping for homeowners insurance. HomeLife offers a policy for semiannual premiums of $408, or they can join a co-op for $50 and pay just $68 per month for comparable coverage. Which option is less expensive in the long run?  We'll write a system of equations and graph them, as we did in . If stands for the number of months, then the total cost of the co-op insurance is and the HomeLife policy costs because a semiannual premium covers 6 months. The solution of the system represents the time when the costs of the two policies are equal. The graphs of the two equations are shown below.   parallel lines  As you can see, the two lines are parallel, so the graphs do not intersect. This system has no solution. There is no point where the two policies cost the same amount; the HomeLife policy is always less expensive.  In , the two graphs never intersect, so the system has no solution. Such a system is called inconsistent system of equations inconsistent  inconsistent system of equations . There is a third possibility: Both equations may have the same graph.  Solve the system  We graph the first equation by the slope-intercept method: Its graph is shown below.   graph of line  The second equation, which has the form , is easier to graph by the intercept method. You can verify that its intercepts are and . The graph of the second line is identical to the first graph.  Every solution to the first equation is also a solution to the second equation, so every point on the line is a solution of the system as well. The system has infinitely many solutions.  We can verify that the two equations in are actually equivalent by solving the second equation for in terms of . The second equation is the same as the first equation. A system in which the two equations are equivalent is called dependent system of equations dependent dependent system of equations . A dependent system has infinitely many solutions: Every point on the graph is a solution to the system.  We have now seen three types of systems. These are illustrated in the figure below. Most of the systems we will study have exactly one solution. Such systems are called consistent and independent consistent and independent .   three types of systems   system of equations inconsistent  inconsistent system of equations  system of equations dependent  dependent system of equations  system of equations consistent and independent  consistent system of equations  independent system of equations   Consistent and independent system. The graphs of the two lines intersect in exactly one point. The system has exactly one solution.  Inconsistent system. The graphs of the equations are parallel lines and hence do not intersect. An inconsistent system has no solutions.  Dependent system. All the solutions of one equation are also solutions to the second equation, and hence are solutions of the system. The graphs of the two equations are the same line. A dependent system has infinitely many solutions.   What does the graph of an inconsistent system look like? How many solutions does it have? Parallel lines; none  What does the graph of a dependent system look like? How many solutions does it have? A single line; infinitely many    Problem Solving with Systems  Many practical problems involve two or more unknown quantities. Often it is easier to solve these problems by using two variables and writing a system of equations.  Allen has been asked to design a rectangular Plexiglas plate whose perimeter is 28 inches and whose length is three times its width. What should the dimensions of the plate be?  Step 1 The dimensions of a rectangle are its length and width, so we let represent the width of the plate and represent its length.  Step 2 We must write two equations about the length and width of the plate. We know a formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, , so the first equation is We also know that the length is three times the width, or . These two equations make a system.  Step 3 We use the intercept method to graph the first equation, :                We use the slope-intercept method to graph : Their graphs are shown below.   graph of system  The graphs intersect at approximately . You can verify that and are a solution to the system by checking that these values make both equations true.  Step 4 The width of the plate should be 3.5 inches and its length should be 10.5 inches.   When might you use a system of equations to solve an applied problem?

Answers to Skills Warm-Up           Lesson  Activity 1: Solving Systems by Graphing  A biologist wants to know the average weights of two species of birds in a wildlife preserve. She sets up a feeder whose platform is actually a scale, and mounts a camera to monitor the feeder. She waits until the feeder is occupied only by members of the two species she is studying, robins and thrushes. Then she takes a picture, which records the number of each species on the scale, and the total weight registered.  From her two best pictures, she obtains the following information.  The total weight of three thrushes and six robins is 48 ounces, and  The total weight of five thrushes and two robins is 32 ounces.   Begin by assigning variables to the two unknown quantities:  Write two equations about the weights of the birds:  Use the intercept method to graph each equation on the grid at right.  Equation (1):            Equation (2):              grid     Locate the point where the two graphs intersect. What are its coordinates?  Answer the question posed by the biologist.   Activity 2: Problem Solving  The manager for Books for Cooks plans to spend $300 stocking a new diet cookbook. The paperback version costs her $5, and the hardback costs $10. She finds that she will sell three times as many paperbacks as hardbacks. How many of each should she buy?  Let represent the number of hardbacks and the number of paperbacks she should buy.   Write an equation about the cost of the books.  Write a second equation about the number of each type of book.  Graph both equations on the grid and solve the system. Then answer the question in the problem.    grid      Activity 3: Inconsistent and Dependent Systems  Robert and Ruth are moving from Los Angeles to Baltimore. Robert is driving a rental truck at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. Ruth leaves one day later in their car, and averages 65 miles per hour. When Ruth set out, Robert had already traveled 300 miles. When will Ruth catch up with Robert?   Let stand for the number of hours that Ruth has traveled. When she catches up with Robert, they will both have traveled the same distance, so we begin by writing equations for the distance, , each has traveled after hours.  Ruth travels at 65 miles per hour, so an equation for the distance she has traveled is  Robert's speed is 50 miles per hour, but he has already traveled 300 miles when Ruth starts, so his distance is given by  Together, the two equations form a system:  Next, we graph both equations on the same axes.   To graph the equation for Ruth's distance, plot a few points.              To graph the equation for Robert's distance, use the vertical intercept and the slope.  Locate the point where the two graphs intersect. What are its coordinates?    grid     Finally, we interpret the solution.  What does the -coordinate of the intersection point tell you about the problem?  What does the -coordinate of the point tell you?  Verify that the intersection point is a solution of both equations in the system.

We wrote a system of equations for this problem,   where is the number of months the refrigerator has been running. We looked for a point on the graphs where the two -values, which represent the costs, are equal. This point is the intersection point of the graphs, as shown in the figure. The -coordinate of the intersection point shows that the costs are equal after 50 months.  graph  We can also solve the system using algebra.  Solve the system algebraically.

We can think of this procedure as substituting the expression for from one equation into the other equation, like this:   substitution  Look Closer  The method works well in this example because both equations in the system were already in the form . Sometimes we must solve one of the equations for in terms of before we can substitute.  Use substitution to solve the system.  We first solve one of the equations for in terms of . It is easier to solve the first equation for , by subtracting from both sides to get: We now substitute the expression for in the other equation:  substitution This gives us an equation in one variable, which we can solve as usual. We begin by simplifying the left side. This is the -coordinate of the solution point. To find the -coordinate, we substitute into either of the original equations. It is easiest to use the equation we solved for , namely . The solution to the system is , or the point . You can check that these values satisfy both of the original equations in the system.   What is the first step in the substitution method? Solve one of the equations for in terms of  How can you check your answer for the solution of a system? Check that the values satisfy both equations in the system.   Here is a summary of the substitution method.  To Solve a System by Substitution  system of equations solve by substitution method   Choose one of the variables in one of the equations. (It is best to choose a variable whose coefficient is 1 or .) Solve the equation for that variable.  Substitute the result of Step 1 into the other equation. This gives an equation in one variable.  Solve the equation obtained in Step 2. This gives the solution value for one of the variables. Substitute this value into the result of Step 1 to find the solution value of the other variable.    Elimination Method  A second algebraic method for solving systems is called elimination elimination method elimination method system of equations . As with the substitution method, we try to obtain an equation in a single variable, but we do it by eliminating one of the variables in the system. We first put both equations into the general linear form, .  Solve the system  First, we rewrite each equation in the form .       We add the equations together by adding the left side of the first equation to the left side of the second equation, and then adding the two right sides together, as follows: Note that the -terms canceled, or were eliminated. We are left with an equation in that is easy to solve: We are not finished yet, because we must still find the value of . We can substitute our value for into either of the original equations, and solve for . We'll use the second equation, : Thus, the solution is the point .  Look Ahead  You may have noticed that this method worked because the coefficients of in the two equations were opposites, and . This caused the -terms to cancel out when we added the two equations together. What if the coefficients of neither nor are opposites? Then we must multiply one or both of the equations in the system by a suitable constant.  Solve the system  We can choose to eliminate either the -terms or the -terms in a system. For this example, it will be faster to eliminate the -terms. If we multiply each term of the second equation by , then the coefficients of will be opposites: Note carefully that we must multiply each term by , not just the -term. We can then replace the second equation by its new version to obtain a new system, and we add the equations together: The -terms were eliminated, and we solve the resulting equation for to get . Finally, we substitute into either of the equations to find . The solution is .  In , we multiplied both sides of the equation by . (This is an application of the Multiplication Property of Equality.) We must be careful to multiply every term on both sides of the equation by the same constant. Otherwise, we won't have an equivalent equation -- its solutions will not be the same.  Linear Combination  linear combination  When we add a multiple of one equation to the other we are making a linear combination of the equations.  The method of elimination is also called the method of linear combinations linear combination linear combination system of equations . Sometimes it is necessary to multiply both equations by suitable constants in order to eliminate one of the variables.  Use linear combinations to solve the system  This time we choose to eliminate the -terms. We must arrange things so that the coefficients of the -terms are opposites, so we look for the smallest integer that both 2 and 5 divide into evenly. (This number is called the lowest common multiple , or LCM, of 2 and 5.) The LCM of 2 and 5 is 10.  We want one of the coefficients of to be 10, and the other to be . To achieve this, we multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by . Adding these new equations eliminates the -term and yields an equation in . We solve for to find . Finally, we substitute into the first equation and solve for . The solution to the system is .   What is a linear combination of expressions? A sum of multiples of the expressions  What is the first step in the elimination method? Write both equations into the general linear form, .   Here are the steps for solving a system by elimination.  To Solve a System by Elimination  system of equations solve by linear combinations  system of equations solve by elimination  Write each equation in the form .  Decide which variable to eliminate. Multiply each equation by an appropriate constant so that the coefficients of that variable are opposites.  Add the equations from Step 2 and solve for the remaining variable.  Substitute the value found in Step 3 into one of the original equations and solve for the other variable.   Look Ahead  How do you know which method to use to solve a system, substitution or elimination? Both methods will work on any linear system. However, substitution will be easier if one of the variables in one of the equations has a coefficient of or . Otherwise, the elimination method is usually more efficient.   How do we eliminate a variable from a system? Add appropriate multiples of the equations.  When is the substitution method easier than elimination? When one of the variables in one of the equations has a coefficient of or .    Inconsistent and Dependent Systems  system of equations inconsistent  inconsistent system of equations  system of equations dependent  dependent system of equations  Recall that a system of two parallel lines has no solution and is called inconsistent. If the two equations in a system have the same graph, then every point on the graph is a solution and the system is called dependent. The elimination method will reveal whether the system falls into one of these two cases.  Solve each system by elimination.      To eliminate the -terms, we multiply the first equation by 2 and add:  graph of parallel line  Both variables are eliminated, and we are left with the false statement . There are no values of or that will make this equation true, so the system has no solutions. The graph shows that the system is inconsistent.  To eliminate the -terms, we multiply the first equation by and add:    coincident lines  We are left with the true but unhelpful equation . The two equations are in fact equivalent (one is a constant multiple of the other), so the system is dependent. The graph of both equations is shown in the figure.  illustrates a rule for identifying inconsistent and dependent systems.  When Using Elimination to Solve a System  system of equations inconsistent  inconsistent system of equations  system of equations dependent  dependent system of equations   If combining the two equations results in an equation of the form then the system is inconsistent.

  "body": "Problem Solving with Systems system of equations problem solving with  In this section we explore some applications of systems of equations. We begin by reviewing some familiar formulas.  Interest interest  Recall the formula for calculating interest, where is the interest you will earn after years if you invest a principal of dollars in an account that earns simple interest at an annual rate .  Notice the difference between interest, , and interest rate, . The interest rate is a percentage, such as 5%. The interest is the amount of money you earn, usually in dollars.  If we make two or more investments at the same time, then the total interest we earn is the sum of the interests earned on each investment separately.   Harvey deposited $1200 in two accounts. He put $700 in a savings account that pays 6% annual interest rate, and the rest in his credit union, which pays 7% annual interest rate. How much will Harvey's investments earn in two years?  Step 1 Calculate the interest earned by each account.  Step 2 Add the earnings from the two investments.   $154  Here is a similar example with variables.   You have $5000 to invest for one year. You want to put part of the money into bonds that pay 7% interest rate and the rest of the money into stocks, which involve some risk but will pay 12% if the investment is successful.   Fill in the table.      Amount invested in stocks  Amount invested in bonds  Interest from stocks  Interest from bonds  Total interest   $500       $1000       $3200       $4000       Now suppose you invest dollars in the stocks and dollars in the bonds.  Finally, suppose that you earned a total of $345 in interest from your two investments. Write an equation about this, using your expressions from part (b).        Amount invested in stocks  Amount invested in bonds  Interest from stocks  Interest from bonds  Total interest   $500  $4500  $35  $540  $575   $1000  $4000  $70  $480  $550   $3200  $2800  $224  $216  $440   $4000  $1000  $280  $120  $400   $5000;    What formula do we need for interest problems?  What is the difference between principal and interest? Principal is the amount invested; interest is the amount earned.   Mort invested money in two accounts, a savings plan that pays 8% interest and a mutual fund that pays 7% interest. He put twice as much money in the savings plan as in the mutual fund. At the end of the year Mort's total interest income was $345. How much did he invest in each account?  The unknown quantities are the amounts Mort invested in his two accounts.  Do not confuse the amount Mort invested in each account (the principal) with the amount he earned in interest! A table is a good way to keep these amounts straight.     Principal  Interest Rate  Interest  Savings plan   0.08   Mutual fund   0.07    We must write two equations for the problem, one about the principal and one about the interest.  Equation about Principal: From the statement \"He put twice as much money in the savings plan as in the mutual fund,\" we write the equation   Equation about Interest: From the statement \"Mort's total interest income was $345,\" we write the equation   This gives us a system of equations. Because the first equation is already solved for in terms of , we'll use the substitution method to solve the system. We substitute for in the second equation and solve for . Finally, we substitute into the first equation to find Thus, Mort invested $3000 in the savings plan and $1500 in the mutual fund.   What were the two equations in about? Principal and interest  Which method did we use to solve the system in ? Substitution    Mixtures percent  mixtures mixtures percent  A pharmacist has on hand 20 ounces of a certain drug at 40% strength, but she needs a small quantity of the drug at 75% strength for a prescription. She decides to add a pure form of the drug to the 40% solution. How much should she add to make a mixture of 75% strength?  To solve such problems, we review some properties of percent. We will need the percent formula,  stands for the part obtained when we take percent of a whole amount, .   You have two jars of marbles. The first contains 40 marbles, of which 10 are red, and the second contains 60 marbles, of which 30 are red.  What percent of the marbles in the first jar are red?  What percent of the marbles in the second jar are red?  You pour both jars of marbles into a larger jar and mix them together.  picture  How many marbles total are in the larger jar?  How many red marbles are in the larger jar?  What percent of marbles in the larger jar are red?  Can we add the percents for the first two jars to get the percent red marbles in the mixture?  25%, 50%  100, 40, 40%  No  In Warm-Up 3, you should find that adding the percent of red marbles in the first two jars does not give the percent of red marbles in the mixture. That is,  In general, we cannot add percents unless they are percents of the same whole amount.   What formula do we need for mixture problems?  When can we add percents? Only if they are percents of the same whole amount    In a local city council election, your favored candidate, Justine Honest, ran in a small district with two precincts. Ms. Honest won 30% of the 500 votes cast in Precinct 1 and 70% of the 300 votes cast in Precinct 2. Did Candidate Honest win a majority (more than 50%) of the votes in her district?  Step 1 Fill in the first two rows of the table, using information from the problem and the formula .       Total votes ( )  Percent for Honest ( )  Votes for Honest ( )   Precinct 1      Precinct 2      Entire district      Step 2 Add down to complete the first and third columns of the table.  Step 3 Fill in the last entry in the table to answer the question in the problem. Use the formula again.   No; 45%  So far we have considered mixture problems involving discrete objects, such as marbles or votes. The same methods apply to mixtures of liquids.  A chemist wants to produce 45 milliliters of a 40% solution of carbolic acid by mixing a 20% solution with a 50% solution. How many milliliters of each should he use?  picture   We let represent the number of milliliters of the 20% solution he needs and the number of milliliters of the 50% solution. We use a table to organize the information. The first two columns contain the variables and information given in the problem: the number of milliliters of each solution and its strength as a percent.       Number of Milliliters ( )  Percent Acid ( )  Amount of Acid ( )   20% Solution      50% Solution      Mixture      We fill in the last column of the table by using the formula . The entries in this last column give the amount of the important ingredient (in this case, milliliters of acid) in each component solution and in the mixture.       Number of Milliliters ( )  Percent Acid ( )  Amount of Acid ( )   20% Solution      50% Solution      Mixture      Now we can write two equations about the mixture problem. The first equation is about the total number of milliliters mixed together. The chemist must mix milliliters of one solution with milliliters of the other solution and end up with 45 milliliters of the mixture, so The second equation uses the fact that the acid in the mixture can only come from the acid in each of the two original solutions. We used the last column of the table to calculate how much acid was in each component, and we add these quantities to get the amount of acid in the mixture. These two equation make up a system: To simplify the system we first multiply the second equation by 100 to clear the decimals. We solve the system by elimination. Multiply the first equation by , and add the equations together. Solving for , we find . We substitute into the first equation to find or . The chemist needs 15 milliliters of the 20% solution and 30 milliliters of the 50% solution for the mixture.  Look Closer  Notice that, in , once we have completed the table, it is easy to write a system of equations; we simply add down the first and third columns of the table. (Remember that we cannot add down the middle column, because percents don't add!)   What were the two equations in about? Total amount of mixture and amount of acid  Which method did we use to solve the system in ? Elimination   Mixture problems are easy to solve if you complete a table first. The rows of the table represent the two components and the final mixture, and the columns are used to calculate the amount of the important ingredient in each. Here is a sample table that you can customize for the specifics of a particular problem.       Total Amount ( )  Percent of Important Ingredient ( )  Amount of Important Ingredient ( )   First Component      Second Component      Mixture       Motion  motion problems  We can also use systems of equations to solve problems involving motion at a constant speed. We'll need the formula .  Geologists can calculate the distance from their seismograph to the epicenter of an earthquake by timing the arrival of the P and S waves. They know that P waves travel at about 5.4 miles per second and S waves travel at 3.0 miles per second. If the P waves arrived 3 minutes before the S waves, how far away is the epicenter of the quake?  Let represent the distance from the seismograph to the epicenter. The time it took for the waves to arrive is also unknown, so we'll let be the travel time for the P waves, in seconds. The travel time for the S waves is then seconds.  We organize all this information in a table.     Rate  Time  Distance  P waves     S waves      We can now write two equations about the problem, one for the P waves and one for the S waves, using the formula . We solve the system by substitution. We substitute for in the second equation, and then solve for . Thus, it took the P waves 225 seconds to arrive at the seismograph. To solve for the distance , we substitute into the first equation to find The epicenter is located 1215 miles from the seismograph.   What formula do we need for motion problems?  What did and represent in in ? represented the distance from the seismograph to the epicenter, and represented the travel time for the P waves    Skills Warm-Up   For part (b) of each problem, write an algebraic expression in two variables.

  "body": "A chemist wants to produce 45 milliliters of a 40% solution of carbolic acid by mixing a 20% solution with a 50% solution. How many milliliters of each should he use?  picture   We let represent the number of milliliters of the 20% solution he needs and the number of milliliters of the 50% solution. We use a table to organize the information. The first two columns contain the variables and information given in the problem: the number of milliliters of each solution and its strength as a percent.       Number of Milliliters ( )  Percent Acid ( )  Amount of Acid ( )   20% Solution      50% Solution      Mixture      We fill in the last column of the table by using the formula . The entries in this last column give the amount of the important ingredient (in this case, milliliters of acid) in each component solution and in the mixture.       Number of Milliliters ( )  Percent Acid ( )  Amount of Acid ( )   20% Solution      50% Solution      Mixture      Now we can write two equations about the mixture problem. The first equation is about the total number of milliliters mixed together. The chemist must mix milliliters of one solution with milliliters of the other solution and end up with 45 milliliters of the mixture, so The second equation uses the fact that the acid in the mixture can only come from the acid in each of the two original solutions. We used the last column of the table to calculate how much acid was in each component, and we add these quantities to get the amount of acid in the mixture. These two equation make up a system: To simplify the system we first multiply the second equation by 100 to clear the decimals. We solve the system by elimination. Multiply the first equation by , and add the equations together. Solving for , we find . We substitute into the first equation to find or . The chemist needs 15 milliliters of the 20% solution and 30 milliliters of the 50% solution for the mixture. "

They know that P waves travel at about 5.4 miles per second and S waves travel at 3.0 miles per second. If the P waves arrived 3 minutes before the S waves, how far away is the epicenter of the quake?  Let represent the distance from the seismograph to the epicenter. The time it took for the waves to arrive is also unknown, so we'll let be the travel time for the P waves, in seconds. The travel time for the S waves is then seconds.

Combine like terms on each side of the equation.  By adding or subtracting the same quantity on both sides of the equation, get all the variable terms on one side and all the constant terms on the other.  Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable to obtain an equation of the form .    Lesson 4.2 Systems of Linear Equations  A pair of linear equations in two variables considered together is called a system of linear equations , or a linear system .  A solution to a system of linear equations is an ordered pair that satisfies each equation in the system. It is the intersection point of the two lines described by the system.  There are three types of linear systems:  Consistent and independent system . The graphs of the two lines intersect in exactly one point. The system has exactly one solution.  Inconsistent system. The graphs of the equations are parallel lines and hence do not intersect. An inconsistent system has no solutions.  Dependent system. All the solutions of one equation are also solutions to the second equation, and hence are solutions of the system. The graphs of the two equations are the same line. A dependent system has infinitely many solutions.   Lesson 4.3 Algebraic Solution of Systems  To Solve a System by Substitution   Choose one of the variables in one of the equations. (It is best to choose a variable whose coefficient is 1 or .) Solve the equation for that variable.  Substitute the result of Step 1 into the other equation. This gives an equation in one variable.  Solve the equation obtained in Step 2. This gives the solution value for one of the variables. Substitute this value into the result of Step 1 to find the solution value of the other variable.   To Solve a System by Elimination  Write each equation in the form .  Decide which variable to eliminate. Multiply each equation by an appropriate constant so that the coefficients of that variable are opposites.  Add the equations from Step 2 and solve for the remaining variable.  Substitute the value found in Step 3 into one of the original equations and solve for the other variable.   When Using Elimination to Solve a System   If combining the two equations results in an equation of the form then the system is inconsistent.  If combining the two equations results in an equation of the form then the system is dependent.   Lesson 4.4 Applications of Systems  We can use tables to organize the information in applications involving interest, mixtures, or motion.  The formula for calculating interest is  is the interest you will earn after years if you invest a principal of dollars in an account that earns simple interest at an annual rate .  The formula for calculating percents is  stands for the part obtained when we take percent of a whole amount, .  In general, we cannot add percents unless they are percents of the same whole amount.  To solve problems involving motion at a constant speed we use the formula \\blert{D=RT}  stands for the distance you travel at speed in time .   Lesson 4.5 Point-Slope Form  Point-Slope Formula  To find an equation for the line of slope passing through the point , we use the point-slope formula  or  To Fit a Line through Two Points  Compute the slope between the two points.  Substitute the slope and either point into the point-slope formula.   Review Questions  Use complete sentences to answer the questions.  State the two-point formula for slope.  How can you find the equation of a line when you know the slope of the line and one point on the line?  How can you find the solution to a linear system by graphing?  Name two algebraic methods for solving linear systems.  Suppose you are using the elimination method to solve a system. How can you tell if the system is dependent or inconsistent?  How would you label the columns when making a table for a problem about interest?  How would you label the columns when making a table for a problem about a mixture?  How would you label the columns when making a table for a problem about motion?  Under what conditions can we add percents?  Explain why the distributive law does not apply to the expression .

  "body": "Exponents  What is an Exponent?  exponent  The area of a rectangle area of rectangle is given by the formula . The variable stands for the length of the rectangle, and stands for for its width. The area tells us how many square tiles, one unit on a side, will fit inside the rectangle, as shown below.  box  Similarly, the volume of a box volume of box (measured in cubic units) is given by the formula , where , and stand for the length, width, and height of the box. The volume tells us how many blocks, one unit on a side, will fit inside the box. The volume of the box shown above is  A square square is a rectangle whose length and width are equal. If we use , for side, to stand for both the length and width of the square, its area is given by  A cube cube is a box whose length, width, and height are all equal, so its volume is given by  cube   What is the formula for the volume of a box?   Finding the area of a square or the volume of a cube involves repeated multiplication by the same number. We indicate repeated multiplication with a symbol called an exponent .  Exponent  exponent  base exponent and  power  power exponent  An exponent is a number that appears above and to the right of a particular factor factor . It tells us how many times that factor occurs in the expression.  The factor factor to which the exponent applies is called the base , and the product is called a power of the base.  For example,   meaning of exponent  We read the expression as the \"fifth power of 2,\" or as \"2 raised to the fifth power,\" or simply as \"2 to the fifth.\"  Exponents  exponent  An exponent indicates repeated multiplication. where is a positive integer.   What does an exponent tell us? How many times a particular factor occurs in an expression   Compute the following powers.      Note that does not mean 3 times 4 or 12; we already have a way to write . Remember that an exponent or power indicates repeated multiplication of the base.  Look Closer  Because the exponents 2 and 3 are used frequently, they have special names. These names come from the formulas for the area, , of a square with side and the volume, , of a cube with edge :   Powers of Negative Numbers  power of negative number  power of negative number  To show that a negative number is raised to a power, we enclose the negative number in parentheses.  For example, to indicate the square of , we write If the negative number is not enclosed in parentheses, then the exponent applies only to the positive number, and the negative sign tells us that the power is negative. For example,  Look Closer  Note how the placement of parentheses changes the meaning of the expressions in .  Compute each power.       Only 4 is squared:  The negatvie number is squared:  Only 4 is squared:  Only 4 is squared, and the entire expression appears within parentheses:   How do we indicate that a negative number should be raised to a power? We enclose the negative number in parentheses.    Using a Calculator  Scientific calculators usually have a key labeled or , called the power key, for computing powers. To compute using the power key, we enter Graphing calculators have a caret key, , for entering powers. On a graphing calculator, we enter as  7 4 ENTER   Also, many calculators have a key labeled for computing squares of numbers.  Use a calculator to compute the powers.     We enter the following key strokes:  or    ENTER  to find that .  If your calculator has a key, you can enter to find that . On a graphing calculator, we enter   12  4   When using a calculator to compute a power of a negative number, we must remember to enclose the number in parentheses. For example, which sequence will calculate the square of ? The first sequence tells the calculator to square 3, then make the result negative. The second sequence tells us to square square (multiply by itself).   Powers of Variables  power of a variable  We can also use exponents with variables. We must be careful to distinguish between a product of a variable and a power of a variable.  power of a variable  An exponent on a variable indicates repeated multiplication, while a coefficient in front of a variable indicates repeated addition.  Compare the expressions and .  These two expressions are not the same! The expressions and are not equivalent; they are not equal for all values of . (Can you think of one value of for which they are equal?)   What is the difference between an exponent and a coefficient? An exponent indicates repeated multiplication, while a coefficient indicates repeated addition.    Order of Operations  How do exponents fit into the order of operations?  Compare the expressions and .  In the first expression, only the is cubed. Thus,  The two expressions are not equivalent, as you can see by evaluating each for, say, .  exponent  base exponent and  power  An exponent applies only to its base, and not to any other factors in the product. If we want an exponent to apply to more than one factor, we must enclose those factors in parentheses.  Look Closer  Think about the operations in .  To evaluate , we compute the power first, and then the product, .  To evaluate , we compute the product inside parentheses first, and then compute the power. \/  When simplifying an expression, we perform powers before multiplications, but after operations within parentheses. Thus, we include exponents in the order of operations as follows.  Order of Operations  order of operations  order of operations powers   Perform any operations inside parentheses, or above or below a fraction bar.  Compute all indicated powers.  Perform all multiplications and divisions in the order in which they occur from left to right.  Perform additions and subtractions in order from left to right.  Simplify  We simplify the expression within parentheses first.   In the order of operations, when do we evaluate powers? After operations inside parentheses   It is especially important to follow the order of operations when evaluating an expression.  When we substitute a negative number for the variable, we enclose the negative number in parentheses.  Evaluate each expression for .       We replace by , and then square. This means that gets squared, not just 6. Thus, The parentheses are essential for this calculation. It would be incorrect to write .  In this expression, only is squared. The negative sign is applied to the result.  We replace by to get  When we replace by , for clarity we also change the existing parentheses to brackets.   Like Terms  like terms involving exponents  In Chapter 2 we learned how to add or subtract like terms. For example, We can also combine like powers of the same variable. For instance,  Look Closer  Notice that when we add like terms, we do not alter the exponent; only the coefficient of the power changes. Can we add different powers of the same variable? The answer to this question is No. For example, For most values of , the numbers and are different. Thus, and are not like terms, and they cannot be combined.  Combine like terms where possible.     The exponents on the two terms are the same, so they can be combined. We add the coefficients, , and leave the powers unchanged:  The exponents on the terms are different, so they are not like terms. They cannot be combined.  When adding like terms, we do not add the exponents. For example,   How do we combine like terms? We add the coefficients and leave the powers unchanged.   In the next Example we compare adding expressions and multiplying expressions.  Simplify the expressions.  Add:  Multiply:   These are like terms, so they can be combined. We add the coefficients, , and leave the variable unchanged:  This product can be written as We use the commutative law to rearrange the factors and multiply to find   Skills Warm-Up   Follow the order of operations to simplify each expression.

Suppose we would like to draw a square whose area is 25 square inches. How long should each side of the square be?  Because the formula for the area of a square is , the side should satisfy the equation . We want a number whose square is 25. As you can probably guess, the length of the square should be 5 inches, because . We say that 5 is a square root of 25.  Square Root  square root  square root radical  The number is called a square root of a number if .  square root  Finding a square root of a number is the opposite of squaring a number.  Find a square root of 25, and a square root of 144.  5 is a square root of 25 because .  12 is a square root of 144 because .  Look Closer  5 is not the only square root of 25, because as well. Thus, 25 has two square roots, and .  Every positive number has two square roots, one positive and one negative.   What is the square root of a number ? A number whose square is .    Radicals  radical  The positive square root of a number is called the principal square root principal square root square root principal . The symbol denotes the positive or principal square root. Thus, we may write The symbol is called a radical radical sign ( ) sign, and the number inside is called the radicand radicand . Square roots are often called radicals radical .  What about the other square root, the negative one? If we want to indicate the negative square root of a number, we place a negative sign outside the radical sign, like this: If we want to refer to both square roots, we use the symbol , read \"plus or minus.\" For example, Note that zero has only one square root: .  Find each square root.     What is the positive square root of a number called? The principal square root  What is a radicand? The number inside a radical sign   Every positive number has two square roots, and zero has exactly one square root. What about the square root of a negative number? For example, can we find ?  The answer is No, because the square of any number is positive (or zero). Try this yourself: The only reasonable candidates for are and , but   We cannot find the square root of a negative number. We say that the square root of a negative number is undefined square root undefined square root undefined complex number .   How do we find the square root of a negative number? The square root of a negative number is undefined.    Rational and Irrational Numbers  Rational Number  rational number  A rational number is one that can be expressed as a quotient (or ratio) of two integers, where the denominator is not zero.  The term \"rational\" has nothing to do with being reasonable or logical; it comes from the word ratio. Thus, any fraction such as is a rational number. Integers are also rational numbers, because any integer can be written as a fraction with a denominator of 1. (For example, ). All of the numbers we have encountered before this chapter are rational numbers.   What is a rational number? One that can be expressed as a quotient of two integers   Every fraction can be written in decimal form.  Decimal Form of a Rational Number  rational number decimal form  The decimal representation of a rational number has one of two forms.  The decimal representation terminates, or ends.  The decimal representation repeats a pattern.  Write the decimal form for each rational number.     We can use a calculator or long division to divide the numerator by the denominatorto find .  We divide 4 by 11 to find . The line over the digits 36 is called a repeater bar, and it indicates that those digits are repeated forever.   How can you recognize a rational number in its decimal form? It either terminates or repeats a pattern.   What about the decimal form for ? If you use a calculator with an eight-digit display, you will find However, this number is only an approximation, and not the exact value of . (Try squaring and you will see that which is not exactly 5, although it is close.) In fact, no matter how many digits your calculator or computer can display, you can never find an exact decimal equivalent for . is an example of an irrational number.  Irrational Number  irrational number  An irrational number is one that cannot be expressed as a quotient of two integers.  Look Closer  There is no terminating decimal fraction that gives the exact value of . The decimal representation of an irrational number never ends, and does not repeat any pattern! The best we can do is round off the decimal form and give an approximate value. Nonetheless, an irrational number still has a precise location on the number line, just as a rational number does. The figure below shows the locations of several rational and irrational numbers on a number line.  numberline  Real Numbers  real number  Each point on a number line corresponds either to a rational number or an irrational number, and these numbers fill up the number line completely. The rational and irrational numbers together make up the real numbers , and the number line is sometimes called the real line real line real line number line .   What are the rational and irrational numbers together called? The real numbers   It is important that you understand the distinction between an exact value and an approximation.   We cannot write down an exact decimal equivalent for an irrational number.  We often use a decimal approximation for a rational number.   Of course, even though many radicals are irrational numbers, some radicals, such as and , represent integers or fractions. Integers such as 9 and 25, whose square roots are whole numbers, are called perfect squares perfect square square perfect .   Order of Operations  When we evaluate algebraic expressions that involve radicals, we must follow the order of operations as usual. Square roots occupy the same position as exponents in the order of operations: They are computed after parentheses but before multiplication.  Find a decimal approximation to three decimal places for .  You may be able to enter this expression into your calculator just as it is written. If not, you must enter the operations in the proper order. The expression has two terms, 8 and , and the second term is the product of with .  We should not begin by subtracting 2 from 8, because multiplication precedes subtraction. First, we find an approximation for : Do not round off your approximations at any intermediate step in the problem or you will lose accuracy at each step! You should be able to work directly with the value on your calculator's display.  Next, we multiply our approximation by to find Finally,we add 8 to get Rounding to three decimal places gives 2.708  In , it is not true that is equal to . The order of operations tells us that we must perform the multiplication first, then add the result to . You can verify that , which is not the same answer we got in .  We can now update the order of operations by modifying Steps 1 and 2 to include radicals.  Order of Operations  order of operations with radicals   Perform any operations inside parentheses, or above or below a fraction bar.  Compute all indicated powers and roots.  Perform all multiplications and divisions in the order in which they occur from left to right.  Perform additions and subtractions in order from left to right.   When do we evaluate roots in the order of operations? After parentheses but before products and quotients    Cube Roots  roots cube cube root  Imagine a cube whose volume is 64 cubic inches. What is the length, , of one side of this cube? Because the volume of a cube is given by the formula , we must find a number that satisfies We are looking for a number whose cube is 64. With a little trial and error we can soon discover that . The number is called the cube root of 64, and is denoted by .  Cube Root  roots cube cube root  The number is called a cube root of a number if .   because .  is an irrational number approximately equal to , because .  Recall that every positive number has two square roots, and that negative numbers do not have square roots. The situation is different with cube roots.  roots cube cube root  Every number has exactly one cube root. The cube root of a positive number is positive, and the cube root of a negative number is negative.  Just as with square roots, some cube roots are irrational numbers and some are not. Cube roots are treated the same as square roots in the order of operations.   What is the cube root of a number ? A number whose cube is  How many cube roots does a negative number have?

  "body": "Using Formulas  Volume and Surface Area  volume surface area  In Section 5.1 we used exponents to calculate the area of a square and the volume of a cube.  Volume and Surface Area  volume surface area  area  area surface area   Volume is the amount of space contained within a three-dimensional object. It is measured in cubic units, such as cubic feet or cubic centimeters.  Surface area is the sum of the areas of all the faces or surfaces that contain a solid. It is measured in square units.  We saw that the area of a square whose side has length units is given by square units, and the volume of a cube of side units is gven by cubic units. Many other useful formulas involve exponents. The figure below shows several solid objects, along with formulas for their volumes and surface areas.   solids   At the Red Deer Pub and Microbrewery there is a spherical copper tank in which beer is brewed. If the tank is 4 feet in diameter, how much beer does it hold?  The formula for the volume of a sphere is , where is the radius of the sphere. The tank has diameter 4 feet, so its radius is 2 feet. We substitute into the formula, and simplify, following the order of operations. (If your calculator does not have a key for , you can use the approximation .) The tank holds approximately 33.5 cubic feet of beer, or about 251 gallons.   What are the units of volume? Cubic units  What are the units of surface area? Square units   Look Closer  What does it mean for the volume of a round tank to be measured in \"cubic\" units? If we pour all the beer in the tank into a rectangular box, that box will hold 33 and a half cubes that measure 1 foot on each side.   Solving Equations with  equation with equation with quadratic equation  Taking a square root is the opposite of squaring a number. Thus, we can undo the squaring operation by taking square roots. For example, to solve the equation we take the square root of each side. Saying that equals 64 is the same as saying that is a square root of 64. Remember that every positive number has two square roots, so we write The equation has two solutions, and .  The volume of a can of soup is 582 cubic centimeters, and its height is 10.5 centimeters. What is its radius?  The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula . We substitute for and for , then solve for . Because the radius of a soup can cannot be a negative number, we discard the negative solution in this application. The radius of the can is 4.2 centimeters.  The equations above, which involve the square of the variable (such as or ), are called quadratic equations quadratic equation , and we shall see more about them later.   What operation is the opposite of squaring a number? Taking a squre root    Pythagorean Theorem  Pythagorean Theorem  A triangle in which one of the angles is a right angle, right angle or , is called a right triangle right triangle . The side opposite the right angle is the longest side of the triangle, and is called the hypotenuse hypotenuse . The other two sides of the triangle are called the legs leg (of a right triangle) .  If we know the lengths of any two sides of a right triangle, we can find the third side using a formula called the Pythagorean Theorem. We use the variable for the length of the hypotenuse, and the lengths of the legs are denoted by and (it doesn't matter which is which).  Pythagorean Theorem  Pythagorean Theorem  If stands for the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, and the lengths of the two legs are represented by and , then  right triangle  The Pythagorean theorem says that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the two legs.  The length of a rectangle is 17 centimeters and its diagonal is 20 centimeters long. What is the width of the rectangle?  The diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, as shown in the figure. We are looking for the width of the rectangle, which forms one of the legs of the right triangle. We use the Pythagorean Theorem.    rectangle with diagonal      We compute the powers, then solve for . We use a calculator to evaluate the square root and find that the width of the rectangle is approximately 10.536 centimeters.   What is a right triangle, and what is the hypotenuse? A triangle in which one of the angles is a right angle; the longest side  What do we use the Pythagorean theorem for? To find a side of a right triangle    Solving for One Variable  formula solving for one variable  In the formula in , the variable occurs more than once. We substitute the value for each time it occurs.  If a principal of dollars is invested at interest rate , the formula gives the amount of money in an account after years. (The \"amount,\" , is the original principal plus the interest earned.) How long will it take an investment of $5000 to grow to $7000 in an account that pays 6% interest?  We substitute for , for , and for in the formula, and then solve the resulting equation for . However, the answer to the question in the problem is not 6.15 years! Because interest is paid only once a year, the investor must wait until the end of the seventh year before the account contains at least $7000.  To simplify the right side of the equation it is not correct to add the two 5000's and write . Remember that multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.  If we plan to use a formula more than once with different values for the variables, it may be faster in the long run to solve for one of the variables in terms of the others. We have already done something like this when we put a linear equation into slope-intercept form: in that situation we solved for in terms of .  formula solving for one variable  Solve the formula for .  For this problem, we treat as the unknown and treat all the other variables as if they were constants. We begin by isolating the term containing on one side of the equation. We now have a new formula for in terms of the other variables.  In the expression in , the terms and are not like terms. They cannot be combined.

In this section we see how to multiply algebraic expressions.  Recall that we can simplify a product such as because This calculation is actually an application of the associative property: In a similar way, we can simplify the product by applying the commutative and associative properties:  Look Closer  You can convince yourself that is equivalent to by substituting some values for ; for example, if , then  The commutative and associative properties tell us that we can multiply the factors of a product in any order.  Simplify the product or power.      We apply the commutative property:  To cube an expression means to multiply three copies of the expression together:  We rearrange the factors to group each variable together:  When we add like terms, we do not change the variable in the terms; we combine the coefficients. For example, When we multiply expressions, we multiply the coefficients and we multiply the variables:   Explain the difference between and . The first expression is a sum and the second is a product.    Using the Distributive Law  distributive law with algebraic expressions  We can use the areas of rectangles to investigate products of algebraic expressions. Recall that we find the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length times its width, . We have already used rectangles to visualize the distributive law. Here are some examples.  Calculate the area of the rectangle by adding the areas of each piece. Then use the distributive law to find the product of the algebraic expressions.  rectangle   rectangle   rectangle    State the distributive law, and explain what it means. \"Distribute\" the multiplication to each term inside parentheses.   At this stage it will be helpful to introduce some terminology.  Algebraic Expressions   An algebraic expression with only one term, such as , is called a monomial monomial .  An expression with two terms, such as , is called a binomial binomial .  An expression with three terms is a trinomial trinomial trinomial quadratic trinomial .  The expression is thus called a quadratic trinomial quadratic trinomial , because it involves the square of the variable.  Notice the difference between and :  is the product of two monomials, and we use the commutative property to simplify it:  is the product of a monomial and a binomial, and we use the distributive law to simplify it:   Explain the terms monomial, binomial, and trinomial. Having one term, two terms, or three terms.    Multiplying Binomials  binomial multiplying  multiplying binomials  Consider the rectangle shown at right. As you can see, it is divided into four smaller rectangles. You can verify that we get the same answer when we compute its area in two different ways: We can add up the areas of the four smaller rectangles, or we can find the length and width of the entire large rectangle and then find their product:  rectangle      Look Ahead  Our goal in this Lesson is to understand products of binomials. We can use rectangles to illustrate, or model, the product of two binomials. The rectangles do not have to be drawn exactly to scale; they are merely tools for visualizing products. With a small stretch of the imagination, we can use rectangles to represent negative numbers as well.   Use a rectangle to represent the product .  Write the product as a quadratic trinomial.   We let the first factor, , represent the width of the rectangle, and the second factor, , represent its length.  We find the area of each sub-rectangle, as shown in the figure. Then we add the areas together.  rectangle   We say that is the factored form of the product, and is the expanded form .   When we use a rectangle to model the product of two binomials, what do the two binomials represent? What does their product represent? The lengths of the sides; the area of the rectangle    The Four Terms in a Binomial Product  FOIL (terms of binomial product)  Using a rectangle to multiply binomials illustrates how the distributive law works. Analyzing the rectangle method will help us in a later Lesson, when we reverse the process to factor a quadratic trinomial. Let us take a closer look at the example above.  Look Closer  FOIL (terms of binomial product)  In we computed the product . The top row of the rectangle corresponds to and the bottom row corresponds to  rectangle  Thus, we multiply each term of the first binomial by each term of the second binomial, resulting in four multiplications in all: Each term of the product corresponds to the area of one of the four sub-rectangles, as shown below.  product of binomials and rectangle   The letters indicate the four steps in computing the product: FOIL (terms of binomial product)   stands for the product of the terms in each binomial.  stands for the product of the terms.  stands for the product of the terms.  stands for the product of the terms.  Note how each term of the trinomial product arises from the binomial factors:  FOIL (terms of binomial product)   The quadratic term in the product comes from the First terms.

  "body": " Chapter 5 Summary and Review  Lesson 5.1 Exponents  An exponent tells us how many times its base occurs as a factor in an expression.  To indicate that a negative number is raised to a power, we must enclose the negative number in parentheses.  An exponent on a variable indicates repeated multiplication, while a coefficient in front of a variable indicates repeated addition.  An exponent applies only to its base, and not to any other factors in the product. If we want an exponent to apply to more than one factor, we must enclose those factors in parentheses.  Order of Operations  Perform any operations inside parentheses, or above or below a fraction bar.  Compute all indicated powers.  Perform all multiplications and divisions in the order in which they occur from left to right.  Perform additions and subtractions in order from left to right.  We can add or subtract like powers of the same variable by combining their coefficients; the exponent does not change.   Lesson 5.2 Square Roots and Cube Roots  Square Root  The number is called a square root of a number if .  Every positive number has two square roots, one positive and one negative. The positive square root of a number is called the principal square root.  We cannot take the square root of a negative number.  Cube Root  The number is called a cube root of a number if .  Every number has exactly one cube root.  A rational number is one that can be expressed as a quotient (or ratio) of two integers, where the denominator is not zero.  Decimal Form of a Rational Number  The decimal representation of a rational number has one of two forms.  The decimal representation terminates, or ends.  The decimal representation repeats a pattern.  The rational and irrational numbers together make up the real numbers , and the number line is sometimes called the real line .  Order of Operations  Perform any operations inside parentheses, or above or below a fraction bar.  Compute all indicated powers and roots.  Perform all multiplications and divisions in the order in which they occur from left to right.  Perform additions and subtractions in order from left to right.   Lesson 5.3 Using Formulas  Volume is the amount of space contained within a three-dimensional object, and is measured in cubic units, such as cubic feet or cubic centimeters. Surface area is the sum of the areas of all the faces or surfaces that contain a solid, and is measured in square units.  solids  Taking a square root is the opposite of squaring a number. We can undo the squaring operation by taking square roots.  Pythagorean Theorem  If stands for the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, and the lengths of the two legs are represented by and , then  triangle  If we plan to use a formula more than once with different values for the variables, it may be faster in the long run to solve for one of the variables in terms of the others.   Lesson 5.4 Products of Binomials  When we add like terms, we do not change the variable in the terms; we combine the coefficients. When we multiply expressions, we multiply the coefficients and we multiply the variables.  An algebraic expression with only one term is called a monomial . An expression with two terms is called a binomial , and an expression with three terms is a trinomial . The expression is thus called a quadratic trinomial .  We use the distributive law to expand the product of two binomials. The letters indicate the four steps in computing the product:  stands for the product of the terms in each binomial.  stands for the product of the terms.  stands for the product of the terms.  stands for the product of the terms.   Review Questions  Use complete sentences to answer the questions.  Explain the difference between and .  If , then is called a of 17.  If , then is called a of 17.

In linear equations, the variable cannot have any exponent other than 1, and for this reason such equations are often called first-degree first-degree first-degree linear equation first-degree . In this chapter we'll consider second-degree second-degree second-degree quadratic equations, or quadratic equations quadratic equation .  Quadratic Equations  quadratic equation  A quadratic equation can be written in the standard form where and are constants, and is not zero.  Some examples of quadratic equations are The first equation is already written in standard form, with and . In standard form, the other two equations are  The numbers and are called parameters . They are the coefficients of, respectively, the quadratic term (the -term), the linear term (the -term), and the constant term.  The -term and the -term in a quadratic expression are not like terms, so they cannot be combined.   What is a quadratic equation? Give an example. An equation of the form    Graphs of Quadratic Equations  quadratic equation graph of  quadratic equation graph of parabola  graph of quadratic equation  graph of quadratic equation parabola  equation of parabola quadratic equation  parabola  Quadratic equations appear in a variety of applications. A quadratic equation in two variables has the form Its graph is not a straight line, but a curve called a parabola parabola . The simplest, or basic, parabola is the graph of , shown in the figure.                      parabola  Look Ahead  In the equation for the basic parabola, , we have and . If the parameters have different values, the appearance or location of the graph will be altered. illustrates a parabola that is shifted downward by 4 units.  Graph  We make a table of values and plot the points. The graph is shown at right.                      Note that in this equation, .  parabola   The basic parabola is the graph of what equation?    Solving Quadratic Equations  quadratic equation solving  Consider a simple quadratic equation, This equation tells us that is a number whose square is 16. Thus, must be a square root of 16. Now, 16 has two square roots, and , so these are the solutions of the equation.  We can think of the solution process in the following way. Because is squared in the equation, we perform the opposite operation, or take square roots, in order to solve for .  Look Closer  Remember that every positive number has two square roots, so the equation has two solutions, and . We can also see the two solutions on a graph. The figure at right shows the graph of and a horizontal line at . There are two points on the graph with -coordinate , and their -coordinates are and .  parabola  Solve each equation without using a calculator.      For each equation, we find the square root of the right side. (That is, we find a number whose square gives the right side.) Remember that every positive number has two square roots.  Because  Because  Because  Because   Why do the equations in have two solutions? Because every positive number has two square roots.    Extraction of Roots  extraction of roots  The figure at right shows a graph of the quadratic equation .                      You can see that there are two points on the graph for each -value greater than . For example, the two points with -coordinate 7 are shown.  parabola  To solve the quadratic equation we need only find the -coordinates of these points. From the graph, the solutions appear to be about and .  How can we solve this equation algebraically? We use the fact that taking square roots is the opposite of squaring.  Solve the equation algebraically.  We first solve for as follows. Once we have isolated , we take the square root of each side to find The exact solutions are thus and . (Don't forget that every positive number has two square roots.) We can also find decimal approximations for the solutions using a calculator. Rounded to two decimal places, the solutions are and .    What are the exact solutions to the equation ?  What are the approximate values of those solutions, rounded to hundredths?  and  and   This method for solving quadratic equations is called extraction of roots . The method applies to quadratic equation of the form , where the linear term is missing.  Extraction of Roots  extraction of roots  quadratic solve by extraction of roots  To solve a quadratic equation of the form  Isolate on one side of the equation.  Take the square root of each side.   Explain how to solve the equation . Isolate , then take square roots.  Why does the equation have two solutions? Every positive number has two square roots.   Look Closer  In the next Example we compare evaluating a quadratic expression and solving a quadratic equation.  A cat falls off a tree branch 20 feet above the ground. Its height seconds later is given by .  What is the height of the cat second later?  How long does the cat have to get in position to land on its feet before it reaches the ground?   In this question, we are given the value of and asked to find the corresponding value of . To do this we evaluate the formula for . We substitute for into the formula, and simplify. The cat is 16 feet above the ground after 0.5 second. You can also use your calculator to simplify the expression for by entering  We would like to find the value of when the height, , is known. We substitute into the equation to obtain To solve this equation we use extraction of roots. We first isolate on one side of the equation.  Next, we take the square root of both sides of the equation to find Only the positive solution makes sense here, so the cat has approximately 1.12 seconds to be in position for landing. A graph of the cat's height after seconds is shown at right. The points corresponding to parts (a) and (b) are labeled.   parabola   In a, did we solve an equation or evaluate an expression? We evaluated an expression.    Solving Formulas  formula solving for a variable (with quadratic term)  Extraction of roots can be used to solve some formulas with a quadratic term.  The formula gives the volume of a cone in terms of its height and radius. Solve the formula for in terms of and .  Because the variable we want is squared, we use extraction of roots. First, we multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction. Because the radius of a cone must be a positive number, we use only the positive square root: .

  "body": "Some Quadratic Models  Revenue  revenue  In this section we consider some applications that lead to quadratic equations. The first application involves revenue.  Revenue is the amount of money a company takes in from selling a product. To find the total revenue from the sale of a product, we multiply the price of one item by the number of items sold.  Revenue  revenue  Revenue (price per item) (number of items sold)  For example, if a snack bar sells 30 sandwiches at $4.25 each, their revenue from sandwiches is  Look Ahead  Usually, the number of items that consumers will buy depends on the price of the item: the higher a company sets the price, the fewer items it is likely to sell. How does a company's revenue depend upon the price it charges? A good way to study such a problem is to consider the graph of the equation for revenue.  Rick works as a personal trainer at his gym. By experimenting with his fee, he discovers that if he charges dollars per hour, he attracts clients.  Write a quadratic equation for Rick's revenue, , in terms of his fee, .  Graph your equation for .  What should Rick charge if he wants to make $300 revenue? How many clients will he attract?  Use your graph to find the fee Rick should charge in order to earn the largest possible revenue. How many clients will he attract at that fee?   Rick's revenue is given by  We make a table of values and plot the points to obtain the parabola shown in the figure.                           parabola  There are two points on the graph with -coordinate 300. Those points have -coordinates 10 and 30. If he charges $10 per hour, he will attract clients, and if he charges $30 per hour, he will attract clients. In either case, his revenue will be $300.  The largest value of that appears on the graph occurs at the point , so when . If Rick charges $20 per hour, he will make $400 in revenue. He will attract clients at that price.   State a formula for calculating revenue. Revenue equals price per item times number of items sold.   Look Closer  In we found a quadratic equation for the revenue Rick earns as a personal trainer. The equation was The graph of this equation is shown again below.  If Rick charges dollars per hour, he will not earn any revenue, so . You can see this fact in the graph, which passes through the point . But there is another point on the graph where ; it has -coordinate . If Rick charges 40 dollars an hour, he will not earn any revenue. (Why does this happen?)  parabola   The Zero-Factor Principle  zero-factor principle  Look again at the equation for revenue in Example 1, The expression for revenue has two factors. The first factor is , and when we have so the revenue is zero as well. The second factor, , is zero when . If Rick charges $40 an hour, his revenue is (Recall that represents the number of clients that Rick will attract if he charges dollars an hour. Apparently, no one will pay $40 an hour for a personal trainer.)  Both of these values, and are solutions of the quadratic equation A quadratic equation has a solution when either of its factors is equal to zero. This is a consequence of the following fact about numbers.  Zero-Factor Principle  zero-factor principle  If the product of two numbers is zero, then one (or both) of the numbers must be zero. Using symbols,  The zero-factor principle also applies to algebraic expressions: If the product of two factors is zero, then one of the factors must be zero.  For what values of is the expression equal to zero?  The expression is equal to zero if either of its factors equals zero. The factor equals zero if , and equals zero if . So equals zero if or .   If you multiply two numbers together and the product is zero, what can you say about the original numbers? At least one of them must be zero.    Factoring  factor factoring  factoring  In order to use the zero-factor principle to solve quadratic equations, we must be able to write quadratic expressions in factored form factored form . This process is called factoring factoring , and it is the reverse of multiplying factors together. Here are some examples comparing multiplying and factoring.    The first type of factoring we consider is the reverse of the distributive law. Consider the expression . The expression has two terms, and , and each term is divisible by 3: We say that 3 is a common factor for the expression because it is a factor of each term. Using the distributive law, we can write We have factored out a common factor, namely 3, from .   What does it mean to factor an expression? To write it as a product of factors.  Factoring is the reverse process for which operation? Multiplying   Factor  We look for the largest common factor for the two terms. Both coefficients are divisible by 9, and divides evenly into both terms. Thus, we factor out and write the expression as You may be able to see the missing factors at a glance, but if not, you can divide each term of the original expression by the common factor, as follows: We fill in these factors for the question marks to obtain the factored form,  You can always check your factorization by computing the product; it should be the same as the original expression.   Explain the meaning of \"common factor.\" An expression that is a factor of each term of another expression    Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring  factoring solve equations by  quadratic equation solve by factoring  Now let's see how to solve a quadratic equation using factoring.  First, we must arrange the terms so that one side of the equation is zero; the zero-factor principle applies only to zero products.  Solve  First, we write the equation in standard form by subtracting from both sides. Next, we factor the left side of the equation. We can take out a common factor of . Now, we apply the zero-factor principle: In order for the product to be zero, one of the two factors must be zero. We set each factor equal to zero, and solve for . Thus, the two solutions are and . You should check that both of these values satisfy the original equation.   What is the first step in solving a quadratic equation by factoring? Arrange the terms so that one side of the equation is zero.   We cannot solve the equation in by dividing both sides by . If we do that, we get the equation . This is one of the solutions, but we have lost the second solution, . We should never divide both sides of an equation by the variable, because we risk losing one of the solutions. Instead, we follow the steps below to solve the equation by factoring.  To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Factoring  factoring solve equations by  quadratic equation solve by factoring   Write the equation with zero isolated on the right side.  Factor the left side of the equation.  Apply the zero-factor principle; that is, set each factor equal to zero.  Solve each equation to obtain two solutions.   Why is it wrong to divide both sides of the equation by ? We lose one of the solutions.    Skills Warm-Up   Mental Exercise: Evaluate each expression for the given values of the variable.

  "body": "Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring  The Zero-Factor Principle  zero-factor principle  In Lesson we applied the Zero-Factor Principle to solve quadratic equations of the form . For reference, here is the statement of the Zero-Factor Principle.  Zero-Factor Principle  If the product of two numbers is zero, then one (or both) of the numbers must be zero. Using symbols,  In order to solve more general quadratic equations, of the form we will need to factor quadratic trinomials. Here is an example of how we can use the principle to solve a quadratic equation.   Compute the product  Solve the equation   We use the FOIL method to apply the distributive law to the product. graphic  From part (a) we see that can also be written in factored form as . Thus, the equation is equivalent to We can apply the Zero-Factor Principle to this equation: If the product is zero, then one of the factors must be zero. Thus, either This means that either or . These are the solutions of the equation, as we verify below.    Why can't we solve the equation in by extraction of roots? Because of the linear term, .    Factoring Quadratic Trinomials  factoring quadratic trinomials  trinomial factoring  In Lesson we learned to factor quadratic expressions of the form . Now we consider quadratic trinomials of the form . Many of these can be factored into the product of two binomials. For example,  How can we come up with the factors of the quadratic trinomial? Let's recall how the product is obtained. We apply the distributive law and multiply each term of the first binomial by each term of the second binomial. We use the word \"FOIL\" to label the four terms of the product: First, Outside, Inside, and Last.     subdivided rectangle   Where does the constant term of the trinomial appear in the product box? In the lower right-hand box.  Where does the linear term appear? In the upper right and lower left boxes.   We make several observations about this product.   FOIL (terms of binomial product)   The quadratic term, , comes from the product of the First terms in each binomial.  The constant term, , is the product of the Last terms.  The middle term, , is the sum of two terms, the product of the Inside terms and the product of the Outside terms.  We can see that the first term of each factor must be , so we only need to fill in the blanks below with the correct numbers: If the two numbers are and , then We see that the constant term of the trinomial is the product , and the linear term of the trinomial has as coefficient the sum .  Thus, to factor , we look for two integers and whose sum is 7 and whose product is 12. With a little trial and error, we discover that the two integers are 3 and 4. So the factored form is  To Factor a Quadratic Trinomial  factoring quadratic trinomials  To factor , we look for two numbers and so that  Factor  The factored form looks like where and . To find the numbers and , it may help to list all possible pairs of numbers whose product is 40. Then we can check each pair of numbers to see which pair has a sum of 13.                           We see that and , so the correct factorization is We can also write the factored form as ; the order of the factors does not matter. Aside from rearranging the factors, there is only one correct factorization for these quadratic trinomials.   To factor , we look for two numbers whose sum is and whose product is . 126; 3393   Look Ahead  In the Activities we'll see how to factor trinomials with negative coefficients. Here are the results.  Sign Patterns for Factoring Quadratic Trinomials  factoring quadratic trinomials  Assume that and are positive integers.   If all the coefficients of the trinomial are positive, then both and are positive.   If the linear term of the trinomial is negative and the other two terms positive, then and are both negative.   If the constant term of the trinomial is negative, then and have opposite signs.   Factor  We look for two integers and for which and . Because is negative, and must have opposite signs. Because is positive, the choices are Because , the correct factorization is You can check the factorization by multiplying the two binomials to see that their product is in fact .   Solving a Quadratic Equation  quadratic equation solve by factoring  Now we can use factoring to solve a quadratic equation.  Solve the equation  We must have the right side equal to zero if we want to apply the Zero-Factor Principle, so we begin by subtracting 18 from both sides to get The solutions are and . You can check that each of these solutions satisfies the original equation.  Before factoring and applying the Zero-Factor Principle, we must write the equation in standard form, so that one side of the equation is zero. Thus, it would not be useful to write We cannot apply the Zero-Factor principle to this equation.   Why can't we solve the equation by setting each factor equal to 18? Just because a product equals 18 does not mean that one of its factors equals 18.   Here is our method for solving a quadratic equation by factoring.  To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Factoring  quadratic equation solve by factoring   Write the equation in standard form,  Factor the left side of the equation.  Apply the Zero-Factor Principle; that is, set each factor equal to zero.  Solve each equation to obtain two solutions.  Solve the equation  You may notice that each term of this equation is twice the corresponding term of the equation in . We can factor out a common factor of 2 from the left side of the standard form of this equation. Then we can divide both sides of the equation by 2. This new equation is the same as the equation in . Thus, the solutions are the same as the solutions in , namely, and .  Look Closer  Multiplying the equation in by a factor of 2 does not affect the solutions of the equation. We can divide both sides of a quadratic (or any) equation by a nonzero constant factor while solving.   Application  Delbert is standing at the edge of a 240-foot cliff. He throws his algebra book upwards off the cliff with a velocity of 32 feet per second. The height of his book above the ground (at the base of the cliff) after seconds is given by the formula where is in feet. The figure below shows a graph of the equation.   parabola  From the graph, we see that it takes the book 5 seconds to reach the ground. Because when the book reaches the ground, 5 is one of the solutions of the quadratic equation Can we solve this equation algebraically, without using a graph?  The equation gives the height of a book above the ground seconds after being thrown off a cliff. How long will it take the book to reach the ground?  We set to obtain the equation It is easier to factor if the coefficient of is positive, so we factor out . Now we are ready to factor the left side of the equation. You can verify that the factorization is Applying the Zero-Factor Principle yields The solutions are and . Because a negative time does not make sense for this problem, we discard that solution. The book takes 5 seconds to reach the ground.   In , why did we set ? When the book reaches the ground, its height is zero.    Skills Warm-Up    Find the linear term of each product mentally.  Find the constant term.          Answers to Skills Warm-Up                       Lesson  Activity 1: Factoring a Quadratic Trinomial  Positive coefficients:  If all the coefficients in the quadratic trinomial are positive, then and are also positive.  Factor as a product of two binomials  The product of the First terms must be , so we place 's in the First spots.  The product of the Last terms is 18, so . There are three possibilities for and : We use the middle term of the trinomial to decide which possibility is correct.  The sum of Outside plus Inside is the middle term, . We check each possibility to see which gives the correct middle term. The last choice is correct, so the factorization is  Factor each trinomial.    Negative linear coefficient:  If the coefficient of the linear term is negative and the constant term is positive, what are the signs of and ?  Factor as a product of two binomials.  We look for a product of the form The numbers and must satisfy two conditions:  Their product, , is the Last term, and so must equal 20.  Their sum, , equals (because ). These two conditions tell us that and must both be negative.  We list all the ways to factor 20 with negative factors:  We check each possibility to see which gives the correct middle term. The second possibility is correct, so the factorization is  Factor each trinomial.    Negative constant term: or  The linear term can be either positive or negative.  Factor as a product of two binomials.  We look for a factorization of the form The product of the two unknown numbers must be negative, . This means that and must have opposite signs, one positive and one negative. How do we decide which is positive and which is negative? We guess! If we make the wrong choice, we can easily fix it by switching the signs.  There are only two ways to factor 15, either 1 times15 or 3 times 5. We just guess that the second factor is negative, and check for each possibility:  The second possibility gives a middle term of . This is not quite correct, because the middle term we want is . We fix this by switching the signs on the factors of 15: instead of using and , we change to and . You can check that the correct factorization is  Factor each trinomial.    The sign patterns we have discovered for factoring quadratic trinomials are summarized below. The order of the terms is very important. For these strategies to work, the trinomial must be written in descending powers of the variable; that is, the quadratic term must come first, then the linear term, and finally the constant term, like this:   Activity 2: Solving Quadratic Equations   Solve each quadratic equation.

  "body": "The Quadratic Formula  quadratic formula   The graph of the equation is shown at right. By reading the graph, we estimate the -intercepts at approximately 1.5 and 3.5. To find their exact values, we must solve the equation   triangle  But, as you can check, the trinomial cannot be factored.  So far we know two methods for solving quadratic equations: extracting roots and factoring. Neither of these methods applies to every quadratic equation. In this Lesson we consider a technique that works on all quadratic equations.   Using the Quadratic Formula  The graph of the quadratic equation depends upon its coefficients, coefficient of quadratic equation  and . In particular, the -intercepts of the graph are determined by the values of these coefficients. In fact, there is a formula that uses the coefficients to calculate the solutions of the equation . It is called the quadratic formula .  The Quadratic Formula  quadratic formula The solutions of the equation are given by the formula  Look Closer  The symbol is used in this context to combine two similar formulas into one. It means that the quadratic equation has two solutions, namely  Use the quadratic formula to solve the equation  We first identify the coefficients and : We substitute the values of and into the quadratic formula, and simplify according to the order of operations. We start with the expression under the radical.  The solutions of the equation are and . These are the exact values of the solutions. We can use a calculator to approximate each solution to hundredths. These values are very close to our estimates from the graph.   What should you do if a quadratic equation cannot be solved by factoring? Use the quadratic formula.   Before we use the quadratic formula, we must write the equation in standard form so that we can identify the coefficients and .   How do we find the values of and in the quadratic formula? They are the coefficients of and and the constant term, respectively.   If some of the coefficients are fractions, it helps to clear the fractions before applying the quadratic formula. The fastest way to clear all the fractions is to multiply each term of the equation by the lowest common denominator, or LCD, of all the fractions involved.   Solve  Find decimal approximations to two decimal places for the solutions.   We multiply each term of the equation by the LCD, , to get Next, we write the equation in standard form and identify the coefficients. We substitute the coefficients into the quadratic formula, and simplify. The exact values of the solutions are and .  We use a calculator to approximate each solution. To two decimal places the solutions are and .   If the coefficients in a quadratic equation are fractions, what should you do? Multiply each term of the equation by their LCD.   Of course, if a quadratic equation can be solved by factoring, then the quadratic formula will give the same solutions. You can use whichever technique seems faster for a particular equation.   Non-Real Solutions  non-real solutions  The graph of has no -intercepts, as you can see in the figure at right. Nonetheless, we can use the quadratic formula to solve the equation   parabola with no x-intercepts  Applying the formula with and , we find We cannot continue with the calculation because is undefined; it is not equal to any real number. This quadratic equation does not have any real-valued solutions, and that is why the graph of does not have any -intercepts.  The solutions to the equation above are a type of number called complex numbers complex number . If a quadratic equation does not have real-valued solutions, then its graph will not have -intercepts.  Every quadratic equation has two solutions. The nature of those solutions determines the nature of the -intercepts of the graph.  -Intercepts of  quadratic equation nature of solutions  The -intercepts of the graph of are the solutions of There are three possibilities.  If both solutions are real numbers, and unequal, the graph has two -intercepts.  If the solutions are real and equal, the graph has one -intercept, which is also its vertex.  If both solutions are non-real non-real complex numbers, the graph has no -intercepts.   If a quadratic equation has no real solutions, what does that tell you about the graph of ? It has no -intercepts.   How many -intercepts does the parabola have?     To find the -intercepts, we solve the equation Because the square root of a negative number is undefined, this parabola has no -intercepts.  We solve the equation This parabola has one -intercept, .   If the solutions of a quadratic equation are equal, what does that tell you about the graph of ? The graph has one -intercept, which is also its vertex.    Skills Warm-Up   Solve each equation by the easiest method.

  "body": " Chapter 6 Summary and Review  Lesson 6.1 Extracting Roots  Quadratic Equations  A quadratic equation can be written in the standard form where and are constants, and is not zero.   The numbers and are called parameters . They are the coefficients of, respectively, the quadratic term (the -term), the linear term (the -term), and the constant term.  The graph of is a curve called a parabola . The simplest, or basic, parabola is the graph of .  Extraction of Roots  To solve a quadratic equation of the form  Isolate on one side of the equation.  Take the square root of each side.    Lesson 6.2 Some Quadratic Models  Revenue (price per item) (number of items sold)  Zero-Factor Principle  If the product of two numbers is zero, then one (or both) of the numbers must be zero. Using symbols,  In order to use the zero-factor principle to solve quadratic equations, we must be able to write quadratic expressions in factored form . This process is called factoring , and it is the reverse of multiplying factors together.  To solve a quadratic equation using factoring, we must arrange the terms so that one side of the equation is zero. Then we set each factor equal to zero, and solve for .   Lesson 6.3 Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring  To Factor a Quadratic Trinomial  To factor , we look for two numbers and so that  To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Factoring  Write the equation in standard form,  Factor the left side of the equation.  Apply the Zero-Factor Principle; that is, set each factor equal to zero.  Solve each equation to obtain two solutions.   Lesson 6.4 Graphing Quadratic Equations  To find the -intercepts of the graph of , we set and solve the equation .  The high or low point of a parabola is called the vertex of the graph. The parabola has an axis of symmetry that runs through the vertex.  The Vertex of a Parabola  The -coordinate of the vertex is the average of the -intercepts.  To find the -coordinate of the vertex, substitute its -coordinate into the equation of the parabola.  To Graph a Quadratic Equation  Find the -intercepts: set and solve for .  Find the vertex: the -coordinate is the average of the -intercepts. Find the -coordinate by substituting the -coordinate into the equation of the parabola.  Find the -intercept: set and solve for .  Draw a parabola through the points. The graph is symmetric about a vertical line through the vertex.    Lesson 6.5 The Quadratic Formula  The Quadratic Formula  The solutions of the equation are given by the formula  If some or all of the coefficients are fractions, it helps to clear the fractions before applying the quadratic formula. The fastest way to clear all the fractions is to multiply each term of the equation by the lowest common denominator, or LCD, of all the fractions involved.  Every quadratic equation has two solutions. The nature of those solutions determines the nature of the -intercepts of the graph.  -Intercepts of  The -intercepts of the graph of are the solutions of There are three possibilities.  If both solutions are real numbers, and unequal, the graph has two -intercepts.  If the solutions are real and equal, the graph has one -intercept, which is also its vertex.  If both solutions are non-real complex numbers, the graph has no -intercepts.  Review Questions  Use complete sentences to answer the questions.  What is the standard form for a quadratic equation?  What are parameters? What is a parabola?  Write down the steps for solving a quadratic equation by extraction of roots.  State the zero factor principle. What is it used for?

  "body": "Polynomials  What is a Polynomial?  polynomial  Polynomial  A polynomial polynomial is an algebraic expression with several terms. Each term is a power of a variable (or a product of powers) with a constant coefficient.  Look Closer  The exponents in a polynomial must be whole numbers, which means that a polynomial has no radicals containing variables, and no variables in the denominators of fractions.  The following expressions are polynomials.            Recall that: An algebraic expression with only one term is called a monomial . An expression with two terms is called a binomial , and an expression with three terms is a trinomial .   The expression is a monomial (it has only one term).  The expression is a binomial (it has two terms).  The expression is called a quadratic trinomial .   Explain the terms monomial, binomial, trinomial, and polynomial. A monomial has one term, a binomial has two terms, a trinomial has three terms, and a polynomial has several terms. Each term is a power of a variable (or a product of powers) with a constant coefficient.    Degree  degree (of a polynomial)  In a term containing only one variable, the exponent of the variable is called the degree degree (of a polynomial) of the term. (The degree of a constant term is zero, for reasons that will become clear in Chapter 9.) For example, The degree of a polynomial in one variable is the largest exponent that appears in any term.  The degree of a polynomial does not depend on the number of terms in the polynomial.   What is the difference between a polynomial of degree four and a polynomial with four terms? Degree four means the largest exponent is four.   Polynomials in one variable are usually written in descending powers of the variable. The term with the largest exponent comes first, then the term with the next highest exponent, and so on down to the constant term, if there is one.  Write the polynomial in descending powers.  We start with the highest power. We must be careful to keep the correct sign of each term.  graphic   What does it mean to write a polynomial in descending powers? Start with the term with the largest exponent, and continue with decreasing exponents.    Evaluating Polynomials  polynomial evaluating  We evaluate polynomials the same way we evaluate any other algebraic expression: by substituting the given values for the variables and then following the order of operations to simplify.  Evaluate for .  Substitute for , and follow the order of operations to simplify.    Like Terms  like terms  Like terms are any terms that are exactly alike in their variable factors. The exponents on the variable factors must also match. For example, are not like terms because their variable factors are different. However, are like terms, because and are equivalent expressions.  like terms adding and subtracting  Recall that: To add or subtract like terms, we add or subtract their numerical coefficients. The variable factors of the terms remain unchanged.   What is the numerical coefficient of a term? The factor in a term that is a constant, not a variable.   Look Closer  Which of the following two expressions can be simplified? In the first expression, the two terms have different exponents, even though the base, , is the same. Powers of the same variable with different exponents are not like terms. The first expression, , cannot be simplified.  In the second expression, and are like terms.Thus, Note that we do not change the exponent on in the sum; it is still 2.  Simplify by combining any like terms:  The terms and are like terms; so are and . We group the like terms together and combine them. The last term, , is not combined with any other terms.   Adding Polynomials  addition of polynomials  polynomial adding  To add two polynomials we remove parentheses and combine like terms.    We can also use a vertical format to add polynomials.  Add and  We first write each polynomial in descending powers of . Then we write the second polynomial beneath the first, aligning like terms.   Subtracting Polynomials  subtraction of polynomials  polynomial subtracting  If an expression in parentheses is preceded by a minus sign, we must change the sign of each term within parentheses when we remove the parentheses. This rule applies when we subtract polynomials.  Subtract the polynomials  We first remove the parentheses, remembering to change the sign of each term of the subtracted polynomial.  In , the following second step is : because we have not changed the sign of term inside parentheses.  To use a vertical format for subtraction, we change the sign of each term in the bottom, or subtracted, polynomial.  Subtract from                 When subtracting two polynomials, what must we do before combining like terms? Change the sign of each term in the subtracted polynomial.    Application  applied problems  Applied problems may involve addition or subtraction of polynomials. In particular, to calculate the profit it earns by selling its product, a company must subtract the cost of producing the goods from the revenue it earns by selling them. We can state this as a formula.   It costs The Cookie Company dollars to produce bags of cookies per week, and they earn dollars from the sale of bags of cookies.  Write a polynomial for the profit earned by The Cookie Company on bags of cookies.  Find the company's profit on 300 bags of cookies, and on 600 bags.   Applying the profit formula to this situation, we subtract polynomials to find  Evaluate the profit polynomial for and for . For 300 bags of cookies, the profit is or $700. For 600 bags of cookies, the profit is The company loses $200 if they produce 600 bags of cookies.   Skills Warm-Up   Replace the comma in each pair by the proper symbol: or .

For instance, consider the product , which can be written as because occurs as a factor 7 times. We see that the number of 's in the product is the sum of the number of 's in each factor.  On the other hand, if we'd like to multiply times , we cannot simplify the product because the two powers do not have the same base. These observations illustrate the following rule.  First Law of Exponents  product of polynomials  exponent first law  To multiply two powers with the same base, we add the exponents and leave the base unchanged. In symbols,  In each product below, we keep the same base and add the exponents.    Each product below is     How do we simplify the product of two powers with the same base?  How do we simplify the product of two powers with different bases?  We add the exponents and leave the base unchanged.  We cannot simplify the product.

Multiply  We apply the distributive law to multiply each term of the polynomial by the monomial . To simplify each term, we group together the coefficients and powers with the same base.   Which algebraic law do we use when we multiply a polynomial by a monomial? The distributive law    Products of Polynomials  product of polynomials  multiplying polynomials  polynomial multiplying  In Chapter 5 we found the product of two binomials using the \"FOIL\" method, a special case of the distributive law. We can also use the distributive law to help us compute products of two or more polynomials.  Multiply  We multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second polynomial. This involves six multiplications: We first multiply each term of the trinomial by , then multiply each term by .   How many terms are there in the product of two trinomials? Nine   Look Closer  If a product contains both polynomial and monomial factors, it is a good idea to multiply the polynomial factors together first, and save the monomial factor for last.  Multiply  We begin by multiplying the binomial factors, . Next we use the distributive law to multiply the result by .   To compute the product , which factors should we multiply first? The binomial factors   In a product of three or more polynomials, we start by multiplying together any two of the three factors.  Multiply  We begin by multiplying together the last two binomials, .

  "body": "More About Factoring  factoring  Quotients of Powers  quotient of powers  We can reduce a fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by any common factors. For example, We first factored the numerator and denominator of the fraction and then canceled the 5's by dividing. We can apply the same technique to quotients of powers.  Simplify.     We first write the numerator and denominator in factored form. Then we divide any common factors from the numerator and denominator. You may observe that the exponent of the quotient can be obtained by subtracting the exponent of the denominator from the exponent of the numerator. In other words,  In this quotient, the larger power occurs in the denominator. We see that we can subtract the exponent of the numerator from the exponent of the denominator. That is,  These examples suggest the following property.  Second Law of Exponents  exponent second law  To divide two powers with the same base, we subtract the smaller exponent from the larger one, and keep the same base.  If the larger exponent occurs in the numerator, put the power in the numerator.  If the larger exponent occurs in the denominator, put the power in the denominator.  In symbols,     In a quotient of powers, how do we know whether the new power appears in the numerator or the denominator? By which has the larger exponent    Quotients of Monomials  quotient of monomials  division of monomials  To divide one monomial by another, we apply the second law of exponents to the powers of each variable.  Divide  We consider the numerical coefficients and the powers of each base separately. We use the second law of exponents to simplify each quotient of powers.   Greatest Common Factors  GCF greatest common factor  greatest common factor  Now we consider several techniques for factoring polynomials. The first of these is factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF).  Greatest Common Factor  greatest common factor  The greatest common factor (GCF) is the largest factor that divides evenly into each term of the polynomial: the largest numerical factor and the highest power of each variable.  Find the greatest common factor for  The largest integer that divides evenly into all three coefficients is 2. The highest power of is , and the highest power of is . Thus, the GCF is . Note that the exponent on each variable of is the smallest exponent that appears on that variable among the terms of the polynomial.   The exponent on each variable of the GCF is the exponent that appears on that variable among the terms of the polynomial. smallest   Once we have found the greatest common factor for the polynomial, we can write each term as a product of the GCF and another factor. For example, the GCF of is , and we can write We can then use the distributive law to write the expression on the right side as a product. We say that we have factored out the greatest common factor from the polynomial.  For more complicated polynomials, we can divide the GCF into each term to find the remaining factors.  Factor  The GCF for this polynomial is , as we saw in . We factor out the GCF from each term and write the polynomial as a product, To find the factor inside parentheses, we divide each term of the polynomial by the GCF. We apply the distributive law to factor from each term.  Look Closer  Sometimes the greatest common factor for a polynomial is not a monomial, but may instead have two or more terms.  Factor  The given expression has two terms, and is a factor of each. We factor out the entire binomial .   Factoring Quadratic Trinomials by Guess-and-Check  factoring quadratic trinomials  guess-and-check method for factoring  So far, we can factor quadratic trinomials of the form , where . Recall that the factored form of looks like  You may want to review the FOIL method discussed in Lesson .  What if the coefficient of is not 1? Sometimes, if the coefficients are small, we can factor a quadratic expression by the guess-and-check method.  Factor into a product of two binomials.  We begin by factoring the quadratic term, , which can only be factored as times , so we can fill in the First terms in each binomial. Next, we factor the constant term, , which can only be factored as 3 times 1. Because the linear term is negative, we make both factors negative: . Finally, we have to decide which number appears as the Last term in each binomial. We check for each possibility. The second choice gives the correct middle term, so the factorization is   When we factor a quadratic trinomial by the guess-and-check method, how do we check for the correct middle term? We compute .   Remember that you can always check your factorization by multiplying the factors together.   Quadratic Trinomials in Two Variables  quadratic trinomial in two variables  So far, we have factored quadratic trinomials in one variable, that is, polynomials of the form The method we learned can also be used to factor trinomials in two variables of the form In this expression, the first and last terms are quadratic terms, while the middle term is a cross-term consisting of the product of the two variables.  Factor  As usual, we begin by factoring the first term into times . Next we look for factors of the last term, . In order to obtain the -term in the middle, we need a in each factor. Thus the possibilities are We'll check the sum for each possibility. The second possibility gives the correct middle term, so the factorization is   Combining Factoring Techniques  factoring  We should always begin factoring by checking to see if there is a common factor that can be factored out.  Factor completely  We begin by factoring out the greatest common factor, . The remaining factor, , is a quadratic trinomial that can be factored. We look for two numbers and so that and . You can check that and will work.  Thus, , and   What should always be the first step in factoring a polynomial? Factor out any common factors.     box method for factoring a quadratic trinomial  If the coefficients in a quadratic trinomial are not prime numbers, the guess-and-check method may be time-consuming. In that case, we can use another technique that depends upon the following property of binomial products.   Compute the product using the area of a rectangle.  Verify that the products of the diagonal entries are equal.   We construct a rectangle with sides and , as shown below. We see that the product of the two binomials is              Now let's compute the product of the expressions along each diagonal of the rectangle: The two products are equal. This is not surprising when you think about it, because each diagonal product is the product of all four terms of the binomials, namely and , just multiplied in a different order. You can see where the diagonal entries came from in our example:   Product of Binomials  box method for factoring a quadratic trinomial  When we represent the product of two binomials by the area of a rectangle, the products of the entries on the two diagonals are equal.   In the previous Example, why are the products on the two diagonals equal? Each is the product of all four terms of the binomials.   Look Ahead  We can use rectangles to help us factor quadratic trinomials. Recall that factoring is the opposite or reverse of multiplying, so we must first understand how multiplication works.  Look Closer  Look carefully at the rectangle for the product  Shown at right.             The quadratic term of the product, , appears in the upper left sub-rectangle.  The constant term of the product, 8, appears in the lower right sub-rectangle.  The linear term, , is the sum of the other two sub-rectangles.   Factoring Quadratic Trinomials by the Box Method  box method for factoring a quadratic trinomial  Now we'll factor the trinomial We'll try to reverse the steps for multiplication. Instead of starting with the factors on the outside of the rectangle, we begin by filling in the areas of the sub-rectangles.   The quadratic term, goes in the upper left, and the constant term, 8, goes in the lower right, as shown in the figure.             What about the other two entries? We know that their sum must be , but we don't know what expressions go in each! This is where we use our observation that the products on the two diagonals are equal.  We compute the product of the entries on the first diagonal: The product of the entries on the other diagonal must also be . We now know two things about those entries:  To find the two unknown entries, we list all the ways to factor , then choose the factors whose sum is .      Factors of   Sum of Factors                We see that the last pair of factors, and , has a sum of . We enter these factors in the remaining sub-rectangles. (It doesn't matter which one goes in which spot.) We now have all the sub-rectangles filled in, as shown at right.             Finally, we work backwards to discover what length and width produce the areas of the four subrectangles.  We factor each row of the rectangle, and write the factors on the outside. Start with the top row, factoring out and writing the result, , at the top, as shown at right. We get the same result when we factor from the bottom row.   The final rectangle is shown at right, and the factors of appear as the length and width of the rectangle. Our factorization is thus              Which terms of the quadratic trinomial go into the upper left and lower right sub-rectangles of the box? The quadratic and constant terms  Why do we list the possible factors of ? To see which sum of factors equals the linear term   Factor   Enter and on the diagonal of the rectangle, as shown in the figure.             Compute the diagonal product:  List all possible factors of , and compute the sum of each pair of factors. (Note that both factors must be negative.)      Factors of   Sum of Factors                The correct factors are and .  Enter the factors and into the rectangle.             Factor from the top row of the rectangle, and write the result, , at the top, as shown below.                         Finally, factor from the bottom row, and write it on the left. The correct factorization is   What do we do after we have filled in all the sub-rectangles of the box? Factor the rows  Where do the factors of the quadratic trinomial appear? As the length and width of the rectangle   Here is a summary of our factoring method.  To Factor Using the Box Method  box method for factoring a quadratic trinomial  factoring the box method   Write the quadratic term in the upper left sub-rectangle, and the constant term in the lower right.  Multiply these two terms to find the diagonal product, .  List all possible factors and of , and choose the pair whose sum is the linear term, , of the quadratic trinomial.  Write the factors and in the remaining sub-rectangles.  Factor each row of the rectangle, writing the factors on the outside. These are the factors of the quadratic trinomial.

  "body": "Special Products and Factors  Squares of Monomials  monomial square of  A few special binomial products occur so frequently that it is useful to recognize their forms. This will enable you to write their factored forms directly, without trial and error. To prepare for these special products, we first consider the squares of monomials.  Study the squares of monomials in . Do you see a quick way to find the product?     Look Closer  In a, we doubled the exponent and kept the same base. In b, we squared the numerical coefficient and doubled the exponent.   Why do we double the exponent when we square a power? Because when we multiply powers with the same base, we add the exponents.   Find a monomial whose square is .  When we square a power, we double the exponent, so is the square of . Because 36 is the square of 6, the monomial we want is . To check our result, we square to see that .   Squares of Binomials  binomial square of  You can use the distributive law to verify each of the following special products.  Squares of Binomials  binomial square of      Explain why it is NOT true that . Because we must square using FOIL.   We can use these results as formulas to compute the square of any binomial.  Expand as a polynomial.  The formula for the square of a sum says to square the first term, add twice the product of the two terms, then add the square of the second term. We replace by and by in the formula.  Of course, you can verify that you will get the same answer for if you compute the square by multiplying .  We cannot square a binomial by squaring each term separately! For example, it is NOT true that We must use the distributive law to multiply the binomial times itself.   How do we compute ?    Difference of Two Squares  Now consider the product In this product, the two middle terms cancel each other, and we are left with a difference of two squares.  Difference of Two Squares  difference of two squares  binomial difference of two squares   Multiply  The product has the form , with replaced by and replaced by . We use the difference of squares formula to write the product as a polynomial.   Explain the difference between and . To simplify , we must square the binomial.    Factoring Special Products  The three special products we have just studied are useful as patterns for factoring certain polynomials. For factoring, we view the formulas from right to left.  Special Factorizations  factoring special factorizations  factoring difference of squares  factoring perfect square trinomial      If we recognize one of the special forms, we can use the formula to factor it. Notice that all three special products involve two squared terms, and , so we first look for two squared terms in our trinomial.  Factor  This trinomial has two squared terms, and . These terms are and , so and . We check whether the middle term is equal to . This is the correct middle term, so our trinomial has the form (1), with and . Thus,   How can we factor ?  How can we factor ?   The sum of two squares, , cannot be factored! For example, cannot be factored. You can check, for instance, that .  Sum of Two Squares  factoring sum of two squares  sum of two squares  The sum of two squares, , cannot be factored.  As always when factoring, we should check first for common factors.  Factor completely  Each term has a factor of 2, so we begin by factoring out 2. The polynomial in parentheses has the form , with and . The middle term is We use equation (2) to write Thus,   What expression involving squares cannot be factored?    Skills Warm-Up   Express each product as a polynomial.          Answers to Skills Warm-Up         Lesson  Activity 1: Special Products   Simplify each square.    Find a monomial whose square is given.    Use a formula to expand each product.       Activity 2: Special Factorizations   Use one of the three formulas to factor each polynomial.     Factor completely.       Wrap-Up  Objectives  In this Lesson we practiced the following skills:  Identifying squares of monomials  Using the fromulas for squares of binomials and difference of squares  Factoring squares of binomials and difference of squares  Knowing that the sum of squares cannot be factored  Questions   Explain the difference between squaring and squaring .  How can you check whether a trinomial might be the square of a binomial?  Explain why we can factor the difference of two squares, but we cannot factor the sum of two squares.

  "body": " Chapter 7 Summary and Review  Lesson 7.1 Polynomials  A polynomial is a sum of terms, each of which is a power of a variable with a constant coefficient and a whole number exponent.  The degree of a polynomial in one variable is the largest exponent that appears in any term.  Like terms are any terms that are exactly alike in their variable factors. The exponents on the variable factors must also match.  To add two polynomials, we need only remove parentheses and combine like terms.  To subtract polynomials, we change the sign of each term within parentheses, remove the parentheses, and combine like terms.   Lesson 7.2 Products of Polynomials  First Law of Exponents  To multiply two powers with the same base, we add the exponents and leave the base unchanged. In symbols,  We use the distributive law to compute products of two or more polynomials.  Lesson 7.3 More About Factoring  Second Law of Exponents  To divide two powers with the same base, we subtract the smaller exponent from the larger one, and keep the same base.  If the larger exponent occurs in the numerator, put the power in the numerator.  If the larger exponent occurs in the denominator, put the power in the denominator.  In symbols,    The greatest common factor (GCF) is the largest factor that divides evenly into each term of the polynomial: the largest numerical factor and the highest power of each variable.  When we represent the product of two binomials by the area of a rectangle, the products of the entries on the two diagonals are equal.  To Factor Using the Box Method   Write the quadratic term in the upper left sub-rectangle, and the constant term in the lower right.  Multiply these two terms to find the diagonal product, .  List all possible factors and of , and choose the pair whose sum is the linear term, , of the quadratic trinomial.  Write the factors and in the remaining sub-rectangles.  Factor each row of the rectangle, writing the factors on the outside. These are the factors of the quadratic trinomial.  We should always begin factoring by checking to see if there is a common factor that can be factored out.   Lesson 7.4 Special Products and Factors  Squares of Binomials     Difference of Two Squares    Special Factorizations      Sum of Two Squares  The sum of two squares, , cannot be factored.   Review Questions  Use complete sentences to answer the questions.  Explain why is a polynomial but is not a polynomial.  A classmate says that is a polynomial, but another classmate disagrees. Who is correct? Explain.  If a polynomial is written in descending powers of the variable and the first term has degree 5, what is the degree of the polynomial? Give an example.  If a polynomial of degree3 is added to a polynomial of degree 2, what is the degree of the sum? Give an example.  A classmate tells you that, depending on the binomials used, the sum of two binomials can have one, two, three, or four terms. Give an example of each.  If a polynomial of degree 3 is multiplied by a polynomial of degree 2, what is the degree of the product? Give an example.  How many terms are there in the square of a monomial? Of a binomial?

Here are some examples:  Look Closer  We can evaluate algebraic fractions just as we do any other algebraic expression. But we cannot evaluate a fraction at any values of the variable that make the denominator equal to zero.   Evaluate for .  For what value of is the fraction undefined?

Applications of Algebraic Fractions  algebraic fraction applications  Envirogreen Technology, Inc. decides to produce a water filter for home use. They spend $5000 for startup costs, and each filter costs $50 to produce. To help her decide on a selling price for the filters, the marketing manager would like to know the average cost per filter if they produce filters. She first computes the total cost of producing filters. Then, to find the average cost per filter, she divides the total cost by the number of filters produced. This expression is an algebraic fraction.  Sketch a graph of the equation  We evaluate the average cost for various production levels, , and make a table of values. We plot the points and connect them with a smooth curve to obtain the graph shown below.                                curve    Reducing Fractions  algebraic fraction reducing  fractions reducing  We can reduce a fraction if we can divide both numerator and denominator by a common factor. In algebra, it is helpful to think of factoring out the common factor first. For example, where we have divided both numerator and denominator by 9. The new fraction has the same value as the old one, namely 0.75, but it is simpler (the numbers are smaller.) Reducing is an application of the fundamental principle of fractions.  Fundamental Principle of Fractions  algebraic fraction reducing  fractions reducing  fundamental principle of fractions  We can multiply or divide the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same nonzero factor, and the new fraction will be equivalent to the old one.  Reduce the fraction  First we consider the numerical part of the fraction: we look for the largest common factor of 42 and 35. This factor is 7, so we write 42 and 35 in factored form: Next, we write the variable parts of the numerator and denominator in factored form. Remember that means and means . Finally, we divide any common factors from the numerator and denominator. The reduced fraction is .  Look Closer  canceling to reduce a fraction  When we apply the fundamental principle, we often say that we are canceling common factors. In this context, \"canceling\" means dividing: Because division is the opposite operation for multiplication, we can cancel expressions that are multiplied together.  Reduce the fraction  We cannot cancel the 4's, because 4 is added to , not multiplied. Instead, we write the numerator as a product instead of a sum. To do that, we factor the numerator. We see that 4 is a factor of the numerator, so we can divide top and bottom of the fraction by 4 to get   What does \"canceling\" mean when we reduce a fraction? Dividing out common factors.   canceling to reduce a fraction  We can cancel common factors (expressions that are multiplied together), but not common terms (expressions that are added or subtracted). Use your calculator to decide which calculation in each pair is correct. (In the second pair, choose a value for the variable and evaluate.)        Look Ahead  canceling to reduce a fraction  canceling to reduce a fraction fundamental principle of fractions  Now we can apply our method to algebraic fractions. We must be very careful to cancel only common factors, never common terms. For this reason, we will think of reducing fractions in two steps: first factor the numerator and denominator completely, then divide by any common factors.  To Reduce an Algebraic Fraction  algebraic fraction reducing  fractions reducing   Factor numerator and denominator completely.  Divide numerator and denominator by any common factors.    Reduce  Evaluate the fraction for .   We first factor the numerator and denominator completely. Then we divide numerator and denominator by any common factors.  If we substitute into the original fraction and simplify, we find However, the reduced fraction, , is equivalent to the original one, so we should get the same answer if we substitute into the reduced fraction:   canceling to reduce a fraction  In , it would be incorrect to \"cancel\" terms of the numerator and denominator separately, as shown below: We must always factor the numerator and denominator before attempting to cancel.   Look Closer  Suppose we'd like to evaluate the fraction in for . Instead of substituting 478 into the original fraction, it is much simpler to use the reduced fraction, and get This the whole point of reducing a fraction: to get a simpler but equivalent expression.   Why is it a good idea to reduce an algebraic fraction when possible? To get a simpler but equivalent expression.    Negative of a Binomial  negative of a binomial  opposite of a binomial  How can we deal with negative factors in a fraction? First, we consider some facts about the negative, or opposite , of an expression.  A fraction is a negative number if either its numerator or its denominator is negative, but not both. For example, However, the fraction is a positive number, because the quotient of two negative numbers is positive.  Look Closer  fractions standard form for writing negative fraction  In algebra, we prefer to write such a fraction with the negative sign in the numerator, so that the standard form for the opposite of is .   Does a negative sign in front of a fraction apply to the numerator, the denominator, or both? Either the numerator or the denominator, but not both.   To find the opposite, or negative, of a binomial (or any other algebraic expression) we multiply the expression by .

This means that your share is of the original cake.  We get the same answer if we use the rule above.  Look Closer  fractions multiplication shortcut There is a shortcut for multiplying fractions that allows us to reduce the answer before we multiply. We do this by dividing out any common factors in a numerator and a denominator. For example, consider the product Notice that 7 divides evenly into one of the denominators (35) and one of the numerators (28). We write the fractions with the 7's factored out. Also, 12 and 9 are both divisible by 3, so we write them in factored form as well. Now we can divide (or \"cancel\") the common factors from the numerators and denominators. Finally, we multiply together the remaining factors in the numerator, and multiply the remaining factors in the denominator.   Use the fundamental principle of fractions to explain why the shortcut strategy is valid. We can multiply or divide the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same nonzero factor, and the new fraction will be equivalent to the old one.   The shortcut strategy also works on algebraic fractions.  Multiply  We begin by factoring each numerator and denominator and then canceling any common factors. Or we can multiply first, and then reduce the answer. We get the same answer with either method.  Look Closer  canceling to reduce a fraction When we multiply algebraic fractions, it is usually easier to cancel common factors before multiplying. Otherwise, it may be very difficult to reduce the result!  To Multiply Algebraic Fractions  product of fractions multiplying fractions fractions multiplying fractions products of   Factor each numerator and denominator completely.  If any factor appears in both a numerator and a denominator, divide out that factor.  Multiply the remaining factors of the numerator and the remaining factors of the denominator.  Reduce the product if necessary.  So far we have considered fractions whose numerators and denominators are monomials. The next example illustrates how to multiply fractions whose numerators and denominators are binomials.  Multiply  We begin by factoring each numerator and denominator. Then we divide numerator and denominator by any common factors.  canceling to reduce a fraction  In , it would be incorrect to try to cancel any terms of numerators and denominators before factoring each binomial. For example, we cannot cancel into , because they are not factors of the fractions.   What was the first step in multiplying the two fractions in ?  Factor each numerator and denominator.   If we want to multiply a fraction by a whole number, we can write the whole number with a denominator of 1. For example,   Quotients of Fractions  quotient of fractions division of fractions fractions dividing fractions quotient of  To divide one fraction by another, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. For example,  Quotient of Fractions  quotient of fractions division of fractions fractions dividing fractions quotient of  If , then  Why does this rule for division work? Consider a simple example, . This quotient asks us \"how many one-thirds are there in six?\" To see the answer, we can draw six whole units as shown below, and split each into thirds.   rectangles  Because there are 3 thirds in each whole unit, we find 63, or 18 thirds in six units. The answer is 18. Now, 3 is the reciprocal of , so by using the reciprocal rule, we also find  Look Closer  For a more interesting example, you might try using the figure above to show that (Hint: How many groups of two thirds can you make from six whole units?)   Explain why dividing a number by is the same as multiplying the number by 3. Dividing by asks \"how many one-thirds are there in the number?\"   Divide:  We replace the second fraction by its reciprocal, and multiply.   To divide two algebraic fractions, we take the reciprocal of the divisor and then follow the rules for multiplying algebraic fractions.  To Divide One Fraction by Another  quotient of fractions division of fractions fractions dividing fractions quotient of   Take the reciprocal of the second fraction and change the division to multiplication.  Follow the rules for multiplication of fractions.  Just as with multiplication, it is important to factor each numerator and denominator before trying to cancel any common factors.  Divide:  First, we change the operation to multiplication by taking the reciprocal of the divisor. Now, we follow the rules for multiplication. We begin by factoring each numerator and denominator. Once we have finished factoring, we can look for any common factors to cancel.   canceling to reduce a fraction  In , do not try to cancel before factoring the numerators and denominators! For example, it would be incorrect to try to cancel before factoring each binomial.  If a nonfractional expression appears in a quotient, we can write it with a denominator of 1, just as we did for products. For example,   Adding Like addition  addition of fractions subtraction of fractions fractions adding and subtracting   addition of fractions subtraction of fractions fractions adding and subtracting  Fractions with the same denominator are called like fractions .  Here are some examples of like fractions: because they have the same denominators. The following pairs are unlike fractions: because they have different denominators.   What are like fractions? Fractions with the same denominator   We can add or subtract two fractions only if they are like fractions, for the same reason that we can add only like terms. For example, becuase and are like terms. Similarly, we can think of the sum as  Look Closer  In the example above, the denominators of the fractions tell us what kind of quantity we are adding (namely, fifths). We can add only quantities of the same kind. Note that we added the numerators, , but kept the same denominator, .  When we add like fractions, we add their numerators and keep the denominator the same.  Sum or Difference of Like Fractions  addition of fractions subtraction of fractions fractions adding and subtracting  If , then  The same rules hold true for adding or subtracting algebraic fractions. We can think of the process as combining the numerators over a single denominator. For example,    In the example above, we do not add the denominators of the fractions; only the numerators. It would be incorrect to write for the denominator of the sum.  Add:  We combine the numerators over a single denominator.    How do we add like fractions? Combine the numerators over a single denominator.    Subtracting Like Fractions  subtraction of fractions fractions adding and subtracting  We must be careful when subtracting algebraic fractions: A subtraction sign in front of a fraction applies to the entire numerator.  Subtract:  We combine the numerators over a single denominator. We use parentheses around to show that the subtraction applies to the entire numerator. We should always check to see whether the fraction can be reduced. Factor the numerator to find    In , be careful to subtract each term of the numerator of the second fraction. The following calculation is incorrect: We must change the sign of each term of the second numerator, to get .  To Add or Subtract Like Fractions  addition of fractions subtraction of fractions fractions adding and subtracting   Add or subtract the numerators.  Keep the same denominator.  Reduce the sum or difference if necessary.   When we subtract like fractions, how do we apply the subtraction sign? To each term of the numerator of the subtracted fraction.    Polynomial Division  division of polynomials polynomial division  Not every fraction can be reduced. Consider three improper fractions: Can these fractions be simplified?  We can reduce the first fraction:  The second fraction reduces to a whole number:  The third fraction does not reduce, but by dividing the denominator into the numerator, we can write it as a whole number plus a proper fraction:  If an algebraic fraction cannot be reduced, we can simplify it by dividing the denominator into the numerator, just as we do with arithmetic fractions. The quotient will be the sum of a polynomial and a simpler algebraic fraction.  If the denominator is a monomial, we can simply divide the monomial into each term of the numerator.  Divide  We divide into each term of the numerator. The quotient is the sum of a polynomial, , and an algebraic fraction, .

Recall that we can only simplify a sum of like fractions. To add or subtract fractions with unlike denominators, we must convert the fractions to equivalent forms with the same denominator.  As an example, we'll compute the sum   We first find the lowest common denominator lowest common denominator for the two fractions. The LCD is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 3 and 4, so in this example the LCD is 12.  Next, we build build (a fraction) fractions each fraction to an equivalent fraction with denominator 12. First, we multiply by . Because is equal to 1, we have not changed the value of the fraction. 4 is called the building factor building factor for . Similarly, we multiply by .  The new fractions, and , are like fractions, so we add them by combining their numerators.   Look Closer  building fractions  fundamental principle of fractions  Building is an application of the fundamental principle of fractions, In words, this says that we can multiply the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same (nonzero) quantity without changing the value of the fraction.   What does it mean to build a fraction? To convert the fraction to an equivalent form with a larger denominator.   We can visualize the building process with diagrams. Here are pictures of the original fractions in our example, and .   rectangle for 2\/3  rectangle for 3\/4  Thirds and fourths are not like fractions -- they are not pieces of the same size. But if we can break up one-third and one-fourth into smaller pieces that are the same size, then we can combine all the pieces. This is what the LCD is for. We can break up both thirds and fourths into twelfths, as shown below.   rectangle for 8\/12  rectangle for 9\/12  We can see from the figure that and . Once we have written the fractions with the same denominator, they are like fractions and we can add them. This is what building fractions is all about.   Adding and Subtracting Unlike Fractions  addition of fractions subtraction of fractions fractions adding and subtracting unlike  We add or subtract algebraic fractions in the same way.  To Add or Subtract Algebraic Fractions  addition of fractions subtraction of fractions fractions adding and subtracting unlike   Find the lowest common denominator (LCD) for the fractions.  Build each fraction to an equivalent one with the LCD as denominator.  Add or subtract the resulting like fractions: Add or subtract their numerators, and keep the same denominator.  Reduce the sum or difference if necessary.  Subtract:  Step 1 We find the LCD: The smallest common multiple of 6 and 15 is 30. Step 2 We build each fraction to an equivalent one with denominator 30. The building factor for the first fraction is 5, and for the second fraction the building factor is 2. Step 3 We subtract the resulting like fractions to obtain Step 4 We reduce the fraction.    What is the first step in adding or subtracting unlike fractions? Find the lowest common denominator (LCD) for the fractions.   In , be careful to subtract each term of the numerator in the second fraction. because   Finding the Lowest Common Denominator lowest common denominator  LCD lowest common denominator  How can we find an LCD for fractions whose denominators are algebraic expressions?  lowest common denominator  The lowest common denominator for two or more algebraic fractions is the simplest algebraic expression that is a multiple of each denominator.  The easiest case occurs when neither denominator can be factored. In that case, their LCD is just the product of the two expressions. For example, the LCD for the fractions and is .  Add:  Step 1 Find the LCD: The LCD is .  Step 2 Build: We build each fraction to an equivalent one with denominator . To find the building factors, we compare the given denominator with the desired LCD. The building factor for each fraction is the missing factor.  Thus, the building factor for is and the building factor for is .  Step 3 Combine: We combine the resulting like fractions.  Step 4 Reduce: The numerator of this fraction cannot be factored, so the sum cannot be reduced.    When can we multiply two denominators together to find their LCD? When neither denominator factors.  How do we find the building factor for each fraction? Compare the given denominator with the desired LCD.   However, if the denominators contain any common factors, the simplest common denominator is not just the product of the two denominators. In this case we must first factor each denominator to find their LCD.   Find the LCD for  The LCD is not . It is true that 216 is a multiple of both 12 and 18, but it is not the smallest one! We can find a smaller common denominator by factoring each denominator. To find an expression that both and divide into evenly, we need only enough factors to \"cover\" each of them separately. In this case two 2's, two 3's, and three 's are sufficient, so the LCD is You can check that is a multiple of both and .  Look Closer  lowest common denominator finding  To find the LCD in , notice that for each factor, we chose the denominator with the most copies of that factor, and included them in the LCD. For example, has only one factor of 3, but has two factors of 3, so we used two factors of 3 in the LCD.  To Find the LCD  Factor each denominator completely, and arrange the factors in order.  For each factor,  Which denominator has the most copies of that factor? Circle them. (If there is a tie, either denominator will do.)  Include all the circled factors in the LCD.  Multiply together the factors of the LCD.   We would like to add two unlike fractions. If each denominator contains one factor of , how many factors of do we include in the LCD? One   Now let us see how to incorporate this new skill into the steps for adding fractions.  Add:  Step 1 To find the LCD, we first factor each denominator completely. The LCD is .  Step 2 We build each fraction to an equivalent one with the LCD as its denominator.  Step 3 Because the fractions are now like fractions, we can combine their numerators.  Step 4 We reduce the fraction by first factoring numerator and denominator, then dividing out any common factors.   State the four steps for adding or subtracting fractions.

This will clear all the denominators at once.  Solve  The LCD of and is 15. We multiply both sides of the equation by 15. Now we can proceed as usual to complete the solution.  In , note that we multiplied each term by the LCD, 15, including terms that are not fractions, namely 2 in this example. Be sure to multiply each term of the equation by the LCD.   When clearing fractions, which terms of the equation should we multiply by the LCD? Every term    Variables in the Denominator  fractions solving equations with variable in denominator  Equations that involve algebraic fractions can also be solved using an LCD.  Solve  The LCD for the two fractions in the equation is . We multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD. We proceed as usual to complete the solution. First we use the distributive law to remove parentheses. The solution is . You can check that satisfies the original equation.   How do we \"clear\" the fractions from an equation? Multiply both sides by the LCD.   Look Ahead  Remember that we do not obtain an equivalent equation if we multiply both sides of an equation by zero. In we multiplied by . Is it possible that equals zero? After solving, we found that , so , which is not zero, and the multiplication step was valid. The next example illustrates what can go wrong if we multiply by zero.   Extraneous Solutions  extraneous solution  solution extraneous extraneous solution  Solve  We multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD, , to clear the fractions. We complete the solution as usual. The solution appears to be . But we have a problem, because the LCD, , equals zero when . We have multiplied both sides of the equation by zero. When we try to check the solution we find Because division by zero is undefined, 3 is not a solution after all. The original equation does not have a solution.  In , when we multiplied both sides of the equation by zero we found a false solution for the equation. Such solutions are called extraneous solutions extraneous solution . There is always a danger that an extraneous solution may be introduced when we multiply by an expression that contains the variable.   When might an extraneous solution be introduced? When we multiply by an expression that contains the variable.   extraneous solution  We should always check for extraneous solutions when solving equations that involve algebraic fractions.  To check a solution, we substitute it into the original equation. If a possible solution causes any of the denominators in the equation to equal zero, then that solution is extraneous. extraneous solution   How do we check for extraneous solutions? See if it causes any of the denominators in the equation to equal zero.    Formulas  formula solving formula with algebraic fractions for a variable  We can also solve formulas that involve algebraic fractions.  Solve for :  The LCD for the two fractions in the equation is . We multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD to obtain Next, we get all the terms containing the desired variable, , on one side of the equation. We add to both sides to get We now have two unlike terms that contain the desired variable. To proceed, we factor out this variable, and then divide both sides by the remaining factor. Thus, the new version of the formula is   When solving a formula, what should we do if there are two terms that contain the variable? Factor out the variable.    Applications  Recall the formula , which is useful in solving problems about motion. By solving for or , we can write the equation in the forms if either of these is more useful for the problem.  A cruise boat travels 18 miles downstream and back in hours. If the speed of the current is 3 miles per hour, what is the speed of the boat in still water?  We let stand for unknown quantity, the speed of the boat in still water. Then we make a table showing the distance, rate, and time for each part of the trip. We begin by filling in the information given in the problem.     Distance  Rate  Time   Downstream trip      Upstream trip      We use the formula to fill in the last column of the table.     Distance  Rate  Time   Downstream trip      Upstream trip      Notice that we did not use the hours in the table, because it was not the trip upstream or the trip downstream that took hours, but the total trip. We use the to write an equation. The sum of the times for the upstream and downstream trips was or hours. To solve the equation, we multiply both sides by the LCD, . Next, we apply the distributive law to multiply each term of the equation by the LCD. We simplify each side of the equation and write it in standard form. The equation is quadratic, and we can solve it by factoring. Finally, we check each solution by substituting into the original equation. Neither solution is extraneous. However, the speed of the boat is not a negative number, so we discard the solution . The boat travels at 9 miles per hour in still water.  Problems involving other types of rates can be solved with similar techniques. Suppose it takes you 8 hours to type a term paper for your history class. If you work at a constant rate, in 1 hour you would complete of your task. The rate at which you work, or your work rate, is one-eighth job per hour. In 3 hours you would complete of the job. In hours you would complete of the job. In general, the amount of work done, expressed as a fraction of 1 whole job, is given by the following formula.

Activity 3: Work Problem  In this application, the work being done is the water flowing into (or out of) the reservoir, so the work rate is the flow rate of water through the pipes.  The city reservoir was completely emptied for repairs, and is now being refilled. Water flows in through the intake pipe at a steady rate that can fill the reservoir in 120 days. However, water is also being drained from the reservoir as it is used by the city, so that it actually takes 150 days to fill. After the reservoir is filled, the water supply is turned off, but the city continues to use water at the same rate. How long will it take to drain the reservoir dry?  Let stand for the number of days for the outflow pipe to drain the full reservoir.  Fraction of the reservoir that is drained in one day:  This is the rate at which water leaves the reservoir.  Now imagine that the intake pipe is open, but the outflow pipe is closed.  Fraction of the reservoir that is filled in one day:  This is the rate at which water enters the reservoir.  Consider the time period described in the problem when both pipes are open. Fill in the table.

  "body": " Chapter 8 Summary and Review  Lesson 8.1 Algebraic Fractions  An algebraic fraction (or rational expression, as they are sometimes called) is a fraction in which both numerator and denominator are polynomials.  An algebraic fraction is undefined at any values of the variable that make the denominator equal to zero.  We use the fundamental principle of fractions to reduce or build fractions.  Fundamental Principle of Fractions  We can multiply or divide the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same nonzero factor, and the new fraction will be equivalent to the old one.  To Reduce an Algebraic Fraction  Factor numerator and denominator completely.  Divide numerator and denominator by any common factors.  We can cancel common factors (expressions that are multiplied together), but not common terms (expressions that are added or subtracted).  A fraction is a negative number if either its numerator or its denominator is negative, but not both.  Negative of a Binomial  The opposite of is    Lesson 8.2 Operations on Algebraic Fractions  Product of Fractions  If and , then  To Multiply Algebraic Fractions  Factor each numerator and denominator completely.  If any factor appears in both a numerator and a denominator, divide out that factor.  Multiply the remaining factors of the numerator and the remaining factors of the denominator.  Reduce the product if necessary.  Quotient of Fractions  If , then  To Divide One Fraction by Another  Take the reciprocal of the second fraction and change the division to multiplication.  Follow the rules for multiplication of fractions.  Fractions with the same denominator are called like fractions.  Sum or Difference of Like Fractions  If , then  To Add or Subtract Like Fractions  Add or subtract the numerators.  Keep the same denominator.  Reduce the sum or difference if necessary.   Lesson 8.3 Lowest Common Denominator  To add or subtract fractions with unlike denominators, we must first convert the fractions to equivalent forms with the same denominator.  The lowest common denominator for two or more algebraic fractions is the simplest algebraic expression that is a multiple of each denominator.  To Find the LCD  Factor each denominator completely, and arrange the factors in order.  For each factor,  Which denominator has the most copies of that factor? Circle them. (If there is a tie, either denominator will do.)  Include all the circled factors in the LCD.  Multiply together the factors of the LCD.  To Add or Subtract Algebraic Fractions  Find the lowest common denominator (LCD) for the fractions.  Build each fraction to an equivalent one with the LCD as denominator.  Add or subtract the resulting like fractions: Add or subtract their numerators, and keep the same denominator.  Reduce the sum or difference if necessary.   Lesson 8.4 Equations with Fractions  To solve an equation that contains algebraic fractions, we first clear the denominators by multiplying both sides of the equation by the LCD of the fractions.  When clearing fractions from am equation, we must be sure to multiply each term of the equation by the LCD. Whenever we multiply an equation by an expression containing the variable, we should check for extraneous solutions .  Work Formula    Review Questions  Use complete sentences to answer the questions.  When reducing an algebraic fraction, we should always before we .  The fundamental principle of fractions says that we can cancel , but not .  Delbert says that to multiply two algebraic fractions, we just multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together. Comment on Delbert's method.  To divide by a fraction is the same as to by its .  Describe how to add or subtract unlike fractions in three steps.  Why do we need to find an LCD when adding unlike fractions?  Francine says that to solve an equation containing algebraic fractions, we build each fraction to an equivalent one with the LCD. Comment on Francine's method.  When might you expect to encounter extraneous solutions?  Which of the operations listed below use an LCD?  add fractions  multiply fractions  solve an equation with fractions  subtract fractions  divide fractions  Which of the operations listed above use building factors?   Review Problems    Evaluate the fraction for  For what value(s) of is the fraction undefined?   ,   Ed's Diner uses a package of coffee filters every days.  What fraction of a package does Ed use every day?  What fraction of a package does Ed use in one week?  For Problems 3 10, reduce the fraction if possible.

On Saturday mornings, Olive takes her motorboat 5 miles upstream to the general store for supplies and then returns home. The current in the river is 2 miles per hour. Let represent Olive's speed in still water, and write algebraic fractions to answer each question.  How long does it take Olive to get to the store?  How long does the return trip take?  How long does the round trip take?      On spring break, Johann and Sebastian both walk from the university to the next town. Johann leaves at noon and Sebastian leaves one hour later, but Sebastian walks 1 mile per hour faster. Let stand for Johann's walking speed. Write polynomials to answer the following questions.  What is Sebastian's walking speed?  How far has Sebastian walked at 3 pm?  How far has Johann walked at 3 pm?  How far apart are Johann and Sebastian at 3 pm?

  "body": "Laws of Exponents  exponent laws of  Products and Quotients  In Chapter 7 we learned the first and second laws of exponents, which we use to compute products and quotients of powers.  Simplify each product or quotient.      To multiply two powers with the same base, we add the exponents and leave the base unchanged.  To divide two powers with the same base, we subtract the smaller exponent from the larger. If the larger exponent occurs in the numerator, we put the power in the numerator.  If the larger exponent occurs in the denominator, we put the power in the denominator.   In a, it is not correct to multiply the bases: The exponents tell us how many copies of the base to multiply together, but the base does not change when we apply the first law of exponents.   Why do we add exponents when we multiply powers with the same base? The exponents tell us how many copies of the base to multiply together.   These laws are expressed in symbols below.   exponent first law  exponent second law  First Law of Exponents  Second Law of Exponents  In this Lesson we'll study three more laws of exponents.   Power of a Power  power of a power  power of a power exponent  Consider the expression , or the cube of . We can simplify this expression as follows. We wrote as a repeated product and applied the first law of exponents to add the exponents. Of course, because repeated addition is actually multiplication, we can just multiply the exponents together: . This gives us another rule.  Third Law of Exponents  exponent third law  To raise a power to a power, keep the same base and multiply the exponents. In symbols,      Note carefully the difference between the two expressions and : The first expression is a product, so we add the exponents. The second expression raises a power to a power, so we multiply the exponents.   Which is larger, or ? Why? is larger because it is a product of three copies of    Power of a Product  power of a product  power of a product exponent  To simplify the expression , we can use the commutative and associative properties of multiplication to write Thus, to raise a product to a power we can raise each factor to the power. This example illustrates the following rule.  Fourth Law of Exponents  exponent fourth law  To raise a product to a power, raise each factor to the power. In symbols,      Note the difference between the two expressions and : In the expression , only the factor is squared, but in both and are squared.   Explain why we cannot use the fourth law of exponents to simpify as . Because is a sum, not a product.    Power of a Quotient  power of a quotient  power of a quotient exponent  To simplify the expression , we multiply together four copies of the fraction . That is, This example suggests the following rule.  Fifth Law of Exponents  exponent fifth law  To raise a quotient to a power, raise both the numerator and the denominator to the power. In symbols,      Why does ? Because .    Using the Laws of Exponents  We can use the laws of exponents along with the order of operations to simplify algebraic expressions. The five laws of exponents are stated together below. All of the laws are valid when the base is not equal to zero and when the exponents and are positive integers.  Laws of Exponents  exponent laws of        Simplify  According to the order of operations, we should perform powers before products, so we first simplify the factor . Now multiply the result by and apply the first law to obtain   In , why did we start by simplifying ? Because we should perform powers before products.   Simplify  Each power should be simplified before we compute their product. Because 4 is an even exponent, is positive, so To simplify , we apply the fourth law of exponents: Finally, we multiply the powers together to get   In the expression , does the negtive sign apply to both factors, or only one of them? Only one of them.    Skills Warm-Up   Simplify each expression according to the order of operations.

But first, what do negative exponents mean? In order for them to be useful, their properties must fit with what we already know about exponents.  We know that means the product of factors of . For example, means . Is there a reasonable meaning for the power ?  Consider the quotient . If is not zero, this quotient equals 1, because any nonzero number divided by itself is 1. On the other hand, we can also think of as a quotient of powers and subtract the exponents. If we extend the second law of exponents to include the case , we have Thus, it seems reasonable to make the following definition.  Zero as an Exponent  exponent zero  zero as an exponent   For example,   Why does it make sense that (as long as )? Because .    Negative Exponents  exponent negative  We can also use the second law of exponents to give meaning to negative exponents. Consider the quotient . According to the second law of exponents, However, if we allow negative numbers as exponents, we can apply the first half of the second law to obtain We therefore define to mean . In general, for , we make the following definition.  Negative Exponents  exponent negative   For example,  exponent negative  A negative exponent indicates the reciprocal of the power with the positive exponent.  Write each expression without exponents.      or 0.0001  To compute a negative power of a fraction, we compute the corresponding positive power of its reciprocal. (This is because of the fifth law of exponents.)  As in part (b), we compute the corresponding positive power of the reciprocal of .   What does a negative exponent mean? The reciprocal of the power with the corresponding positive exponent.   A negative exponent does not mean that the power is negative. For example,  We can also rewrite fractions using negative exponents.  Write each expression using negative exponents.         An exponent applies only to its base. For example, the exponent in the expression applies only to , but in , the exponent applies to . Thus,   Laws of Exponents  The laws of exponents apply to negative exponents. In particular, if we allow negative exponents, we can write the second law as a single rule.  Laws of Exponents  exponent laws of        Simplify by using the first or second law of exponents.     Apply the first law: add the exponents.  Apply the second law: subtract the exponents.  Look Closer  As a special case of the second law, note that , so we can write  Thus,      Here are some examples using the laws of exponents.  Simplify by using the third or fourth law of exponents.     Apply the third law: multiply the exponents.  Apply the fourth law: raise each factor to the power.   What is the difference between and ? is the reciprocal of and is the opposite of .     Powers of Ten  power of ten  Scientists and engineers often encounter very large numbers such as (the mass of the earth in kilograms) and very small numbers such as (the mass of a hydrogen atom in grams) in their work. These numbers can be written in a more compact and useful form using powers of 10.  Recall the following facts about our base-10 number system.  Multiplying by Powers of Ten  multiplying by a power of ten  power of ten   Multiplying a number by a positive power of 10 has the effect of moving the decimal point places to the right, where is the exponent on 10. For example,  Multiplying a number by a negative power of 10 has the effect of moving the decimal point to the left. For example,    What happens to a number when we multiply it by a power of 10?  The decimal point moves to the left or the right.   We can also reverse the process above to write a number in factored form, where one factor is a power of 10.  Fill in the correct power of 10 for each factored form.     To recover from , we must move the decimal point four places to the right, so we multiply by . Thus,  To recover from , we must move the decimal point three places to the left, so we multiply by . Thus,   Scientific Notation  scientific notation  multiplying by a power of ten  If there is just one digit to the left of the decimal point in the factored form, we say that the number is written in scientific notation .  scientific notation  A number is in scientific notation if it is expressed as the product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10.  For example, are written in scientific notation.  To write a number in scientific notation, we first position the decimal point and then determine the correct power of 10.  To Write a Number in Scientific Notation  scientific notation writing in   Locate the decimal point so that there is exactly one nonzero digit to its left.  Count the number of places you moved the decimal point: this determines the power of 10.  If the original number is greater than 10, the exponent is positive.  If the original number is less than 1, the exponent is negative.   Write each number in scientific notation.     We position the decimal point so that there is just one nonzero digit to the left of the decimal. To recover 62,000,000 from 6.2, we move the decimal point seven places to the right. Therefore, we multiply 6.2 by .  We position the decimal point so that there is just one nonzero digit to the left of the decimal. To recover 0.000431 from 4.31, we move the decimal point four places to the left. Therefore, we multiply 4.31 by .  Look Closer  The easiest way to remember which way to move the decimal point is to note whether the number is large (greater than 10) or small (less than 1). For example,  62,000,000 is a large number, so the exponent on 10 in its scientific form is positive. On the other hand,  0.000431 is a decimal fraction less than 1, so the exponent on 10 in its scientific form is negative.    How can you tell whether the exponent in scientific notation should be positive or negative? Note whether the number is large (greater than 10) or small (less than 1).    Calculators and Scientific Notation  Your calculator displays numbers in scientific notation if they have too many digits to fit in the display screen.  Use a calculator to compute the square of 12,345,678.  We enter (and press enter on a graphing calculator.) A scientific calculator displays the result as and a graphing calculator displays (Some calculators may round the result to fewer decimal places.) Both of these displays represent the number .  Look Closer  Because scientific notation always involves a power of 10, most calculators do not display the 10, but only its exponent. If you now press the key, your calculator will display the reciprocal of as This is how your calculator displays the number .  Do not use your calculator's notation when giving an answer in scientific notation. For example, if your calculator reports a result as 3.47 E 8, you should write .   How does your calculator display scientific notation? It does not display the 10, but only its exponent.   Your calculator has a special key for entering numbers in scientific notation.  To enter a number in scientific notation into the calculator, we use the key marked either or .  For instance, to enter , we key in the sequence To enter a number with a negative exponent, such as , on a scientific calculator we key in On a graphing calculator we key in  The People's Republic of China encompasses about 2,317,400,000 acres of land and has a population of 1,335,300,000 people. How many acres of land per person are there in China?  We divide the number of acres of land by the number of people. To do this, we first write each number in scientific notation. We enter the division into the calculator as follows. The calculator displays the quotient, 1.735. Thus, there are about 1.735 acres of land per person in China.   Mental Calculation with Scientific Notation  scientific notation mental calculation with  We can often obtain a quick estimate for a calculation by converting each figure to scientific notation and rounding to just one or two digits.  Use scientific notation to find the product  We can use a calculator (if necessary) to combine the decimal numbers, and the first law of exponents to combine the powers of 10.

For Problems 21 24, use scientific notation to compute.  140   2400    For Problems 25 28, suppose that each of the following numbers is written in scientific notation. Decide whether the exponent on 10 is positive or negative.  The population of Los Angeles County. Positive  The length of a football field in miles.  The number of seconds in a year. Positive  The speed at which your hair grows in miles per hour.   Write each number in scientific notation.  The height of Mount Everest is 29,141 feet.  The wavelength of red light is 0.000 076 centimeters.  ft  cm   Write each number in standard notation.  An amoeba weighs about gram.  Our solar system has existed for about years.  For Problems 31 34, give your answers in scientific notation rounded to two decimal places.  A light year is the distance that light can travel in one year. Light travels at approximately miles per second. How many miles are there in one light year? (One year is approximately seconds.) mi  A 1-foot high stack of dollar bills contains bills.  In January, 2018, the U. S. federal debt was dollars. How tall a stack of one-dollar bills, in feet, would be needed to pay off the federal debt?  Express the height of the stack of bills in part (a) in miles. (One mile equals 5280 feet.)  There are about 200 million insects for every person on earth. In 2018, the world's population is about 7.6 billion people.  How many insects are there on earth?  If the average insect weighs gram, how much do all the insects on earth weigh? Note: figures updated   g   There are 5,800,000 cubic miles of fresh water on earth. Each cubic mile is equal to 110,000,000,000 gallons of water. If the population of earth was about 7.6 billion people in 2018, how many gallons of fresh water were there for each person?    "

Consider the following calculation: This calculation shows that is equal to , because the square of is 8. You can verify on your calculator that and have the same decimal approximation, 2.828.  Show that .   is a number whose square is 45. We can square as follows: Because the square of is equal to 45, it is the case that .   It is usually helpful to write a radical expression as simply as possible. The expression is considered simpler than , because the radicand is a smaller number. Similarly, is simpler than . In this section we discover properties of radicals that help us simplify radical expressions.  In the Activities we will verify the following properties of radicals.   radical product rule  radical quotient rule  product rule radical  quotient rule radical  Product Rule for Radicals  Quotient Rule for Radicals  It is just as important to remember that we do not have a sum or difference rule for radicals. That is, in general,  Decide which statement is true and which is false.     , but , so the first statement is false.  , and , so the second statement is true.   Simplifying Square Roots  square root simplifying  We can use the product rule for radicals to write . Now, , so we can simplify as  The expression is a simplified form for . The factor of 4, which is a perfect square, has been removed from the radical. This example illustrates a strategy for simplifying radicals.  To Simplify a Square Root  square root simplifying   Factor any perfect squares from the radicand.  Use the product rule to write the radical as a product of two square roots.  Simplify the square root of the perfect square.  Simplify .  We look for a perfect square that divides evenly into 45. The largest perfect square that divides 45 is 9, so we factor 45 as Then we use the product rule to write Finally, we simplify to get  Finding a decimal approximation for a radical is not the same as simplifying the radical. In , we can use a calculator to find but 6.708 is not the exact value for . For long calculations, too much accuracy may be lost by approximating each radical. However, is equivalent to , which means that their values are exactly the same. We can replace one expression by the other without losing accuracy.   What is the difference between simplifying a square root and approximating a square root? Simplifying a square root gives an equivalent expression.    Square Root of a Variable Expression  square root of variable expression  To square a power of a variable we double the exponent. For example, the square of is Because taking the square root of a number is the opposite of squaring a number, to take the square root of an even power we divide the exponent by 2.  If is a nonnegative number, Similarly, if is not negative,   How do we simplify the square root of a variable raised to an even exponent? Divide the exponent by 2.   For the rest of this section we'll assume that all variables are nonnegative.  Note that is not equal to . Compare the two radicals:  Look Closer  How can we simplify the square root of an odd power? We write the power as a product of two factors, one having an even exponent and one having exponent 1.  Simplify  We factor as . Then we use the product rule to write Finally, we simplify the square root of to get   How do we simplify the square root of a variable raised to an odd exponent? Write the power as a product of two factors, one having an even exponent and one having exponent 1.   If the radicand contains more than one variable or a coefficient, we consider the constants and each variable separately. We try to remove the largest factors possible from the radicand.  Simplify  We look for the largest perfect square that divides 20; it is 4. We write the radicand as the product of two factors, one of which contains the perfect square and even powers of the variables. That is, Now we write the radical as a product. Finally, we simplify the first of the two factors to find   In , what will we get if we square ?    Sums and Differences  addition of radicals  subtraction of radicals  radical adding  radical subtracting  What about sums and differences of radicals? We cannot add or subtract radicals by combining their radicands. That is,  You can verify some examples on your calculator:     So, we cannot simplify a sum or difference if the expressions under the radical are different. However, we can combine radicals with the same radicand. For example, we can write just as we write  Like Radicals  like radicals  radical like  Square roots with identical radicands are called like radicals .  Look Closer  addition of radicals  subtraction of radicals  radical adding  radical subtracting  We can add or subtract like radicals in the same way that we add or subtract like terms, namely by adding or subtracting their coefficients. For example, where is a variable that can stand for any real number. In particular, if , we have Thus, we may add like radicals by adding their coefficients. The same idea applies to subtraction.   What are like radicals? Square roots with identical radicands   Simplify if possible.     Because and are like radicals, we can combine them as  However, and are not like radicals. We cannot simplify sums or differences of unlike radicals. Thus, cannot be combined into a single term.   How do we add or subtract like radicals? By adding or subtracting their coefficients  How do we add or subtract unlike radicals? Unlike radicals cannot be combined.   Sometimes we must simplify the square roots in a sum or difference before we can recognize like radicals.  Simplify  We simplify each square root by removing perfect squares from the radicals. Then we combine the like radicals and to get   Skills Warm-Up   Find the missing factor.

We can also use the quotient rule to simplify quotients of square roots.  Quotient Rule  radical quotient rule   Simplify  We use the quotient rule to write the expression as a single radical. Then we simplify the fraction inside the radical.   Is it true that we can only simplify a product or quotient of radicals if they are like radicals? No.    Fractions  fractions involving square roots  square root involving fractions  fractions involving square roots rationalizing the denominator  square root involving fractions rationalizing the denominator  When we solve quadratic equations, the solutions are often fractions that involve square roots. Many such fractions can be simplified using properties of radicals.  One of the solutions of the equation is . Simplify this radical expression.  First, simplify the square root: . Thus,  In , note that because and are not like terms. Also note that Because 8 is a term of the numerator, not a factor, we cannot cancel the 8's.   Which of these cannot be reduced: or ? Why? . The numerator cannot be factored.   We can add or subtract fractions involving radicals.  Subtract  The LCD for the two fractions is 6. We build each fraction to an equivalent one with denominator 6, then combine the numerators.   Rationalizing the Denominator  rationalizing the denominator  For some applications, it is easier to work with expressions that do not have radicals in the denominators of fractions. For example, the fraction is equivalent to We multiplied the numerator and denominator by , the same root that appeared in the denominator originally, and thus eliminated the radical from the denominator. This process is called rationalizing the denominator .  Rationalize the denominator of  We simplify the radical before attempting to rationalize the denominator. Now we multiply top and bottom of the fraction by .    What does it mean to rationalize the denominator? To eliminate radicals from the denominator.  What should you do before trying to rationalize a denominator?  Simplify the radicals.    Skills Warm-Up   Each simplification is incorrect.

Radical Equation  equation with radicals  radical equation  A radical equation is one in which the variable appears under a radical.  If you drop a penny from the top of the Sears Tower in Chicago, it will take 9.5 seconds to reach the ground. Find the height of the Sears Tower in meters by solving the equation  To solve the equation, we undo the operations performed on . To undo the operation of taking a square root, we can square both sides of the equation. Remember that we undo the operations in the opposite order, as follows.    Operations performed on   Steps for solution   1. Divide by 4.9   1. Square both sides   2. Take square root   2. Multiply by 4.9   Here is the solution. The Sears Tower is about 442 meters tall.  To Solve a Radical Equation  equation with radicals  radical equation   Isolate the radical on one side of the equation.  Square both sides of the equation.  Continue as usual to solve for the variable.   What is a radical equation? One in which the variable appears under a radical.   Solve the radical equation  We square both sides of the equation to produce an equation without radicals. You can check that satisfies the original equation.   Extraneous Solutions  extraneous solution  The technique of squaring both sides may introduce extraneous solutions . (Recall that an extraneous solution is a value that is not a solution to the original equation.) For example, consider the equation Squaring both sides gives us However, if we substitute into the original equation, we see that it is not a solution. The value is a solution to the squared equation, but not to the original equation. In this case, the original equation has no solution.   When we solve a radical equation, what causes extraneous solutions to be introduced? Squaring both sides of the equation.   Extraneous Solutions  extraneous solution  Whenever we square both sides of an equation, we must check the solutions in the original equation.  If a radical equation involves several terms, it is easiest to isolate the radical term on one side of the equation before squaring both sides.  Solve  We first isolate the radical by subtracting from both sides to get Now we square both sides to obtain The possible solutions are and . We check both of these in the original equation.  For , For , Thus, is an extraneous solution. The only solution to the original equation is .   When squaring both sides of an equation, we must be careful to square the entire expression on either side of the equal sign. It is incorrect to square each term separately. Thus, in , it would not be correct to write   True or false: to solve a radical equation, we should square each term of the equation. Explain. False. We should square each side of the equation.    Equations with Cube Roots  equation with cube roots  cube root equation  cube root equation equation  We can also solve equations in which the variable appears under a cube root.  Solve the equation  We first isolate the cube root. Next, we undo the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Finally, we add 4 to both sides to find the solution, . We do not have to check for extraneous solutions when we cube both sides of an equation, but it is a good idea to check the solution for accuracy anyway.  Substitute for into the left side of the equation.   How can we solve an equation if the variable appears under a cube root? Isolate the cube root, then cube both sides.    Extraction of Roots  extraction of roots  Now we'll compare solving radical equations, where we square both sides, with quadratic equations, where we may be able to take square roots of both sides.  Solve by extraction of roots  We first isolate the squared expression: we divide both sides by 2. Now we solve each equation, to find two solutions. We write the solutions as .   Is it true that ? Why or why not? No. and are not like terms.    Skills Warm-Up   Square each expression.

Solve  Solve  Solve     Activity 2: Roller Coasters  You have been commissioned to design a new roller coaster for an amusement park. The roller coaster should be more spectacular than all existing roller coasters, and in particular it should include a vertical loop. In order to stay on the track through the loop, the cars must travel at a speed given (in miles per hour) by where is the radius of the loop in feet.  Here are three roller coasters with ver tall vertical loops:    Height  Roller Coaster  Location   188 feet  Viper  Six Flags Magic Mountain, Valencia, California   173 feet  Gash  Six Flags Great Adventure, Jackson, New Jersey   170 feet  Shockwave  Six Flags Great Adventure, Gurnee, Illinois    Evaluate the formula to find the speed the cars must reach on each roller coaster. Because the vertical loops used in roller coasters are not perfect circles, the total height of the loop is about 2.5 times its radius.  Viper:  Gash:  Shockwave:  loop  You would like your roller coaster to have a vertical loop that is 200 feet tall. How fast must the cars travel?  Now suppose you know the maximum speed possible for the cars on a particular roller coaster. Can you calculate the height of the tallest vertical loop the cars can negotiate?

In symbols,  Fourth Law of Exponents  To raise a product to a power, raise each factor to the power. In symbols,  Fifth Law of Exponents  To raise a quotient to a power, raise both the numerator and the denominator to the power. In symbols,   Lesson 9.2 Negative Exponents and Scientific Notation  Zero as an Exponent   Negative Exponents   A negative power is the reciprocal of the corresponding positive power. A negative exponent does not mean that the power is negative.  The laws of exponents apply to negative exponents. In particular, if we allow negative exponents, we can write the second law as a single rule.  A number is in scientific notation if it is expressed as the product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10.  To write a number in scientific notation, we first position the decimal point and then determine the correct power of 10.  We can often obtain a quick estimate for a calculation by converting each figure to scientific notation and rounding to just one or two digits.   Lesson 9.3 Properties of Radicals   Product Rule for Radicals  Quotient Rule for Radicals  It is just as important to remember that we do not have a sum or difference rule for radicals. That is, in general,  To Simplify a Square Root  Factor any perfect squares from the radicand.  Use the product rule to write the radical as a product of two square roots.  Simplify the square root of the perfect square.  Finding a decimal approximation for a radical is not the same as simplifying the radical  To take the square root of an even power we divide the exponent by 2.  Square roots with identical radicands are called like radicals .  We can add or subtract like radicals in the same way that we add or subtract like terms, namely by adding or subtracting their coefficients.   Lesson 9.4 Operations on Radicals  We can use the product rule to multiply radicals together:  We can use the quotient rule to simplify quotients of square roots:  We can multiply numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same root that appears in the denominator to eliminate the radical from the denominator. This process is called rationalizing the denominator .   Lesson 9.5 Equations with Radicals  A radical equation is one in which the variable appears under a radical.  To Solve a Radical Equation  Isolate the radical on one side of the equation.  Square both sides of the equation.  Continue as usual to solve for the variable.  The technique of squaring both sides may introduce extraneous solutions .  If a radical equation involves several terms, it is easiest to isolate the radical term on one side of the equation before squaring both sides.  To solve an equation in which the variable appears under a cube root, we isolate the cube root, then cube both sides of the equation.  We do not have to check for extraneous solutions when we cube both sides of an equation.   Review Questions  Use complete sentences to answer the questions.  State the third law of exponents, and compare with the first law.  State the fourth and fifth laws of exponents and give examples.  Give the definition of and give an example.

  "body": " GNU Free Documentation License   Version 1.3, 3 November 2008  Copyright copyright 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. < >  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.    0. PREAMBLE  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document free in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.  This License is a kind of copyleft , which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS  This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The Document , below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as you . You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.  A Modified Version of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.  A Secondary Section is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.  The Invariant Sections are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.  The Cover Texts are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.  A Transparent copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not Transparent is called Opaque .  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.  The Title Page means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, Title Page means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.  The publisher means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.  A section Entitled XYZ means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as Acknowledgements , Dedications , Endorsements , or History .) To Preserve the Title of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section Entitled XYZ according to this definition.  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.    2. VERBATIM COPYING  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.    4. MODIFICATIONS  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:  Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.  State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.  Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.  Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.  Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.  Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.  Include an unaltered copy of this License.  Preserve the section Entitled History , Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled History in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.  Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the History section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.  For any section Entitled Acknowledgements or Dedications , Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.  Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.  Delete any section Entitled Endorsements . Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.  Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled Endorsements or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.  Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.  You may add a section Entitled Endorsements , provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled History in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled History ; likewise combine any sections Entitled Acknowledgements , and any sections Entitled Dedications . You must delete all sections Entitled Endorsements .    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an aggregate if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.    8. TRANSLATION  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.  If a section in the Document is Entitled Acknowledgements , Dedications , or History , the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.    9. TERMINATION  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See .  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License or any later version applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.    11. RELICENSING  Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site (or MMC Site ) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A Massive Multiauthor Collaboration (or MMC ) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.  CC-BY-SA means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.  Incorporate means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.  An MMC is eligible for relicensing if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.  The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.    "
